       "  'desc': 'Even gramps would be proud.On a trip to factories in the Dominican Republic some time ago, I was offered a boatload of a really nice, smooth handmade called 1876 Reserve. I’m guessing the manufacturer either drank too much Dominican rum or his abacus was busted. Don’t get me wrong, I certainly ain’t complaining because I think under normal circumstances it would’ve cost me twice as much to buy what I bought (I better remove his name from the mailing list so he doesn’t see this later). What I do know is that this is an incredibly mellow Dominican cigar that’s well worth our ridiculous 2-fer price. In fact, the buy-in here starts under two bucks apiece! Is that too cheap? Maybe it’s me that’s getting soft in the head. Oh well, if you like easy going cigars, you’ll love this deal.',\n",

The flavorful bouquet includes heavy doses of toasty earthiness served up in a rich but ultimately smooth fashion. The aftertaste is long and pleasant, featuring an enjoyable sweetness that relaxes your palate. The presentation is terrific: nestled inside an attractive, dark, Spanish cedar box, each cigar is handsomely dressed in cedar sleeves. Lastly, for just a few bucks per stick I will boldly state that this cigar may very well be the best bargain in the entire industry.

Each of the flavors seems to come consecutively, a series of layered sensations that hits your senses without overwhelming the palate at any given point. Man. I just re-read that.

If you haven’t been introduced to Aging Room cigars yet, it’s high time you made their acquaintance. Made using very limited batches of tobacco leaves too small for regular production, these premium handmades are highly unique, highly in demand, and of course, highly limited in scope. Take the Aging Room Quattro Original. Sounds like a luxury sports vehicle, and perhaps rightfully so, because it performs like a dream. A flawless 2003 Sumatra wrapper leaf encircles a mix of Cuban-seed Dominican fillers and a Dominican binder. To finish, each is box-pressed and packaged perfectly.\\xa0Aging Room Quattro Original received an esteemed 95-rating and was named #2 Cigar of the Year in 2013 when it was called Quattro F55, with the review noting,\\xa0\"a balanced, sophisticated cigar that displays rich notes of roasted coffee bean and sweet cedar.\"\\xa0',\n",

While there, Rafael discovered an aging process for wine, beer, and brandy called… you guessed it, the “Solera” process. And being the tobacco man he was, Nodal couldn’t wait to apply this unique aging process to premium cigars. Enter Solera: a full line of premiums from Aging Room, featuring four distinct wrappers and unique flavors across the board.\\xa0The Aging Room Solera Sun Grown is a medium-bodied iteration of the blend. Once lit, you’ll find notes of maple, slight nuttiness, and a citrusy zest. It’s a bright a lively cigar, one that performs beautifully on its own, but just does as well with a nice glass of rum or bourbon to accompany it.

Today, we’re staring down the same blend, just donned in a Pennsylvania Broadleaf Maduro wrapper that’s silky-smooth in all the right ways. Lighting this one up, you’ll be greeted with a Molotov cocktail of dark chocolate, espresso, black pepper spice, and a thick, molasses-like sweetness in the background.\\xa0',\n",

Draped in a bold, dark Nicaraguan wrapper and jam-packed with powerful ligeros from Esteli and Condega balanced by the uniqueness of Ometepe tobacco, this rich, medium to full-bodied blend offers an elegant, refined profile. Notes of earth, espresso, and a dense array of sweet and spicy notes characterize its smooth, complex profile. As it burns, the strength and flavors intensify perfectly before an exciting finale. There’s something really special with this one, and knowing how near and dear to AJ this blend is, they planned it that way all along.\\xa0\\u200bGood news! New World by AJ Fernandez has earned a well-deserved 91-rating, noting: \"The earthy, rustic notes of this dark, box-pressed belicoso become more refined and precise, showing cacao and coffee bean qualities before a finish of nuts and fruit.\"',\n",

The wrapper, binder, and filler all come from different farms in order to provide different aspects to the cigar in terms or flavor, aroma and mineral qualities.

Ranging from mellow to full, the new San Lotano Requiem line is sure to satisfy even the most discerning of palates. The Maduro variety of San Lotano Requiem features a dark, oily San Andres maduro wrapper balanced by a blend of premium Nicaraguan and Honduran long-fillers. The end result is a luxurious experience as rich, chocolaty, slightly sweet, and creamy flavors are delivered through billowy layers of thick, flavorful nuances. Medium in body, but loaded with flavor the San Lotano Requiem Maduro is dee-lish. And for added intrigue, I've heard quite a few accounts that mention San Lotano Requiem Maduro's eerie resemblance to Padron Anniversary. I don't disagree.\",\n",

These are the names Alec Bradley Cigar Company’s founder, Alan Rubin, two sons. When Alan Rubin first started the company, they were just kids. But over the past 20 years, they have grown up in the business, learned the heritage, the tradition, techniques, and found a love for tobacco on their own. And Alec & Bradley Blind Faith is the first blend they have created on their own.It starts out with a deep brown Habano wrapper grown in Trojes, Honduras. Underneath is a double binder combination from Honduras and Nicaragua that creates a sturdy, slow burning cigar. The meat is a three-leaf combination or Nicaraguan long-fillers. Medium to full-bodied, Blind Faith provides an evolving cadence of personality. A strong spicy note off the bat gives way to flavors of pepper, nuttiness, and earthiness. If Alec & Bradley’s first crack at a premium cigar blend is and inclination of the future, more good things are to come.\\xa0',\n",

Their first venture into premium handmades was a limited release called Blind Faith, and the first batch quickly sold out. Their second is called Gatekeeper, and trust me when I say, the brothers are already at the top of their game.Gatekeeper comes dressed in an Ecuador Habano wrapper over a Nicaraguan binder, with fillers from the Dominican and Nicaragua. Its smooth, rich profile is accentuated by notes of cedar, nuts, and leather, and the construction is what you would expect from the factory that produces such great sticks as the Prensado.

A word that instantly transports me back to college, fraternities, and the crazy ass stunts we pulled under what would now be called “hazing.” Luckily, this cigar from Archetype isn’t here to make you eat a goldfish. No sir, instead, Archetype Initiation is an adventure in the art of nuanced flavor, presenting an Ecuadorian Habano wrapped blend that any cigar enthusiast can enjoy.\\xa0If you love Habano, Initiation is the cigar for you. From filler to binder to wrapper, every single leaf in this beauty is fine Habano tobacco. The profile weighs in at a comfortable medium, with floral and citrus notes leading the charge for most of the burn. A step up from most Connecticuts on the market, Initiation would make a perfect choice for the new cigar enthusiast who’s looking to try something a bit more complex.\\xa0',\n",

So you can be sure you’re getting quality tobaccos.\\xa0As for the blend itself, Sage Advice features a booming seven different tobaccos. The filler blend is undisclosed, besides the fact that they’re all long leaf. For the binder, you’ll find a Dominican San Vincente leaf, underneath a proprietary hybrid Habano wrapper.

I would comfortably stack this against any medium to full-bodied blend available today....to say Reconquista will compare favorably is an understatement. Gorgeously packed in heavy, giant chests – inside each cigar is individually encased in cedar coffin boxes then laid neatly over a bed of tobacco leaves. As good as this looks, the real juice is unquestionably the blend itself. Reconquista is made in one size only: a stately 7”x54 Torpedo. This big, yet manageable, vitola optimizes the rich blend of aged tobaccos….a size perfectly tailored to the cigar’s formulation. The wrapper is a dark, toothy Habano Oscuro variety grown in Brazil: thick and oily, sodden with a feisty and voluptuous character. Its filler tobaccos combine rich, well-aged, Cuban-seed, Nicaraguan-grown leaves from Esteli, Condega, and Jalapa. The combination explodes with uniquely rich and dense, finely balanced, and smooth flavors. Hearty notes of espresso, pepper, oak, spices, tobacco, and cocoa lightly dust the palate, leading to a toasty-sweet finish.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'desc': 'XO goes to ConnecticutSince they began their revolution in the industry, Balmoral cigars have been an absolute success. Each one of their blends delivers a load of complex, unique flavors and they’ve all been racking up awards across countless publications. So when they told me they were developing a Connecitcut blend, I was more than enthused. Today, we welcome their newest achievement: Balmoral Anejo XO Connecticut.\\xa0Crowned with a shade-grown wrapper from the Connecticut River Valley, these Dominican handmades provide a luxuriously creamy experience. Underneath the genuine US wrapper leaf, an Ecuador Sumatra binder leaf encases Dominican Olor and Pennsylvania long-fillers plus the exclusive, stalk-cut Brazilian Mata Norte leaf that made the original XO so popular. Lighting it up, you’ll find a mixture of vanilla and toasted caramel notes with hints of white pepper.\\xa0Good news! Balmoral Anejo XO Connecticut has received a 92-point rating, noting: \"Topped with a fantail cap, this short blond robusto draws perfectly, imparting a cedary, nutty smoke that also shows notes of coffee bean, vanilla and earth.\"',\n",

       "  'desc': 'A new Nicaraguan, aged to perfection.Balmoral is a name you might not be too familiar with (yet), but the world certainly knows about their parent company Royal Agio. Agio has been making cigars in Europe since 1904 in their factories located in Sri Lanka, the Dominican Republic, Belgium, and the Netherlands, but only recently have premium, long-filler cigars come out of the Dominican factory bearing the name Balmoral. So far every one of their releases has been right on the money, and no holds were barred in the production of their first cigar ever to wear a Nicaraguan wrapper.Underneath the rich Nicaraguan Habano wrapper lies a Cuban-seed Brazilian binder and one of the most unique filler blends we’ve ever seen. The finest, aged Dominican Olor and Nicaraguan Esteli leaves are mixed with Balmoral’s stalk-cut Brazilian Mata Norte, the special leaf responsible for most of the amazing flavors you get from Agio’s premium brand. It took Royal Agio quite some time to perfect this medium-full bodied blend, but when the rich earth and espresso flavors hit your palate, their refusal to compromise becomes immediately evident. Grab a box of Balmoral Anejo XO Nicaragua, and taste the top 5% of tobacco quality.\\xa0',\n",

The result is a medium-bodied profile rife with notes of leather, cedar, spices, and cocoa, with toasty nuances and excellent construction.

Then there was Cain, a full-tilt, \\'straight ligero\\' powerhouse that\\'s rich, bold and complex. And now, there\\'s Cain Nub, a highly-anticipated fusion of these two innovative cigars. All of Cain\\'s flavor in a Nub costume, that\\'s the Cain Nub. Offered in either a thick, leathery Habano leaf or a dark and oily Maduro, Cain Nub employs a robust mixture of long-leaf ligeros from a variety of regions in Nicaragua. Expect a powerful but refined display of complexity including hearty notes of spices, earth and coffee. Full-bodied, full-flavored and impressively smooth, Cain Nub delivers an unmatched experience. Only two sizes were created - a 4\" x 60 vitola with the same amount of tobaccos and burn time as a 6.75\" x 50 Churchill or a 4\" x 64 Torpedo that equals a 7\" x 50 Churchill.',\n",

These cigars were highly limited due to the availability of the wrapper leaf they chose to use. They only shipped to a small group of retailers across the country and they quickly disappeared from the market. But anyone who was lucky enough to taste the cigar raved over the great flavor. Well good news fellas, Anstasia is back with a slight tweak.Now dubbed Anastasia H, they swapped the original wrapper with a well-aged Habano leaf. Just like the original, the rest of the blend is being kept a secret but we’ve been told all the tobaccos are rare and have been patiently aging in the Tabacalera La Alianza factory. It clocks in as a medium to full-bodied blend with notes of caramel, spice, leather, and a creamy smoothness. Snag a box now, Anastasia has been known for a good Irish goodbye.\\xa0',\n",

These are exclusively available to the ‘First 49’, a group of retailers who have supported, and continued to support Caldwell in his ventures. Limited to just 500 boxes of 10, The Last Tsar is currently offered only in a Churchill vitola, although they plan to add another size later in the year. This one’s dressed in a Connecticut Arapiraca maduro wrapper, which is a hybrid leaf not found on almost any other cigars on the market. They didn’t announce the fillers, but what I can tell you is that this cigar is chock-full of delicious flavors of cedar, cocoa, and pepper.

The first Camacho to be produced in Davidoff of Geneva's prestigious Dominican factory, American Barrel Aged showcases bold notes of pepper, cashew, and sweet spices that are accented by a slight undertone of bourbon to deliver a blend you won’t soon forget. \\xa0\\u200b\",\n",

They have a reputation for expertly balancing unmatched flavor with a satisfying boldness. And The Original Diploma is one of their finest and most sought after blends created. It originally debuted in 2001 but soon vanished from the market. Then we saw it again in 2015 for a short run. Then in 2017, the company announced it would return once a year, in a new limited edition size.The blend uses some of the finest tobaccos in the world and is crafted by Camacho’s 5 most skilled torcedores (rollers) in the factory with the leaves hand-selected by the factory supervisor to ensure the best experience possible. The tobacco used is all Honduran Corojo from higher priming’s to add a little extra power. The end result is a medium to full-bodied cigar with balanced notes of wood, cocao, dried fruit, and some pepper on the finish. When this package arrives at your door you’ll be amazed. It’s some of the finest packaging in the industry and one of the best cigars to hit our docks this year.\\xa0',\n",

Camacho often goes head to head with some of the most storied Cuban brands....and comes out on top time after time. These highly complex, intensely flavorful rock star blends come from the fertile soils of Honduras in a climate that rivals the lush Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba. Superior, expertly cultivated tobacco leaves are grown at Ranchos Jamastran under the watchful gaze of the Eiroa family.Camacho Triple Maduro is the world’s first all-maduro cigar. Prepare thyself for an explosion of dark, complex flavors. Triple Maduro was created for fans of a full-bodied blend, and this one is packing heat. You can anticipate rich and hearty undertones of spice and earth that are strong and bold without completely decimating the palate. Evenly constructed and epically dark and inviting, this is one maduro you won’t want to miss. Rumor has it that the Eiroas had to attempt the perfect blend 84 times before they got it right, but by George, they actually did it. ',\n",

When we took pen to paper, crunched numbers to the bone, and delivered a savory blend entitled CI Fresh-Rolled Cuban Wheels, we knew we had a winner on our hands. Little did we know how fast, and how many would be flying off the docks. Keeping up with the demand is a battle, and we’ve been getting stink-eyes from purchasing ever since. But all office battles aside, we knew another addition to the line would be welcomed with opened arms. So after scouring the soils of Central America for a blend worthy enough to wear the CI name, we dialed in a sure bet winner. Hailing from the ultra-rich soils of Esteli, Nicaragua, CI Fresh-Rolled Rosado comes adorning a gorgeous San Agustin Rosado wrapper. Beneath the sheets, a bevy Cuban-seed long-fillers from Nicaragua and Honduras intertwine and deliver a slow burning, enjoyably smooth experience. Notes of sweet spice, wood, and cashew are just a few or the players, and with prices slashed just as much as its predecessor, you’ll be happily partaking in CI Fresh-Rolled Rosado anytime you choose!\\u200b',\n",

In fact, it’s hard not to be downright giddy before, during and after sparking this beauty. Aesthetically, the cigar is stunning, a tightly wound, cigar with a dark, positively first-grade sun-grown Nicaraguan maduro wrapper leaf. This leaf is eye-popping: smooth with nary a vein, glistening with natural oils, and giving off a lovely sheen. Filled to the brim with an intricate blend of aged Nicaraguan fillers, Perdomo’s medium to full-bodied treat instantly awakens your taste buds with a potpourri of wide-ranging flavors. It’s not overly rich however, and the well-balanced profile mellows as you go, occupying the palate with clearly discernible earthy notes, followed by a slightly cedary undertone and mellow spiciness.

The folks over at Crowned Heads are \\xa0sticking to their musically themed cigar lines and have decided to honor Cash with their newest release, Jericho Hill. One of the most influential American singer/songwriters of all time, Johnny’s checkered past compelled him to perform one of his most famous tracks – \\xa0Cocaine Blues, from his renowned concert at Folsom Prison. This is the ballad of a scorned man named Willy Lee whose drug induced rage got him arrested by a sheriff from Jericho Hill. Every aspect of this cigar takes inspiration from the song.Jericho Hill boasts a dark and sultry Mexican San Andres wrapper, which is a nod to both Juarez, Mexico, where Willy Lee was arrested, and to Johnny’s nickname, “Man in Black.” Nicaraguan long-fillers and a Nicaraguan binder help to give Jericho Hill some serious attitude (just like Johnny had). Stuffed to the brim with blasts of pepper, spice, and leather, this is one full-bodied firecracker. Only the most potent of blends would suffice in paying tribute to a legend of Johnny Cash’s stature, and this one fits the bill. RIP, JC.Crowned Heads Jericho Hill received a well-deserved 90-rating noting:\\xa0\"Dark in appearance and flatly pressed, this cigar starts out herbal and woody, but develops heartier notes of toast, nuts and spice that lead to a licorice finish. \"',\n",

I’m done with the sales pitch....Dark Shark sells itself. Buy it or don’t - doesn’t matter to me - I’ve got a long list of guys waiting for their usual 5-10 mazos per month.',\n",

Instead, the latest hit to come out of the Davdioff camp calls on select tobaccos grown in Yamasa, Dominican Republic – a region with a reputation for being difficult to grow in. Davidoff’s newest release, fittingly dubbed Yamasa, demanded that years of industry know-how be put to the test. Yamasa showcases a gorgeous, milk chocolaty wrapper leaf grown in this challenging region that took a team of scientists to perfect…and it’s evident in its seamless appearance. Also featuring a binder from San Vicente, DR and aged long-fillers from Nicaragua, Yamasa excels with hints of sweetness, leather, and rich spices.\\xa0\\u200bGreat news!

It’s a brand that has consistently performed, with each blend under the Diesel name promising a unique experience unlike anything else on the market. To ask for more seems greedy, but, let’s face it — with Diesel, we always want more. Enter the new Diesel Heart of Darkness. A limited edition blend, this one’s pure substance. It’s dark, it’s bold, and it’s unapologetically Diesel. Diesel Heart of Darkness comes in one perfected size: a meaty, 6” x 58 Gordo. Inside each box you’ll find 14 Ecuador Habano Oscuro wrapped gems. The dark, oily wrapper leaf sits atop a potent firecracker blend of all long-fillers from three different regions in Nicaragua, plus some additional Esteli ligero to put this one over the top. Each puff delivers a chewy feast of bitter espresso, earth, black pepper, and salty leather. Prepare for your palate to kick into overdrive as you burn your fingers taking this one down to the nub. If you’ve been around these parts long enough to have seen some other Diesel limited releases, you know as well as I do that this blend is gonna fly. Act quickly son.

This beaut, blended by the masterful hands of A.J. Fernandez is undiluted, unapologetic, and unmatched in its flavor, consistency, and its unbelievable price point.To create Uncut, A.J. selected a robust blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers and finished it with a medium-brown Pennsylvania Broadleaf natural wrapper to deliver a rich, hearty blend loaded with notes of chocolate, nuts, black pepper, and cedar. The strength, complexity, and flavor that you have grown to expect from Diesel, at a price that lets you burn one after another. In short, Uncut is underpriced.\\u200b',\n",

Diesel Uncut, the blend favored by Tabacalera Fernandez’s workers, has quickly become the stuff of full-bodied folklore and with the newest addition to the line they bring a new wrapper to the table. Meet Diesel Uncut d.CT, still bold, and still jam packed with flavor, just with a toned-down intensity.Diesel Uncut d.CT comes dressed in an Ecuadoran Connecticut wrapper sitting atop a Nicaraguan binder and long-fillers.

These phrases no doubt come to mind. Diesel Whiskey Row stays true, but takes a unique approach for the brand. The binder is aged in Rabbit Hole Bourbon barrels – a first for Diesel as well as master blender AJ Fernandez. But have no fear – these bourbon barrels that once held Rabbit Hole Bourbon were first shipped to AJ Fernandez in 2016. After many months of testing, he finally nailed down a process that imparts the perfect amount of flavor and aroma into the tobacco and Diesel Whiskey Row was born.\\xa0The core of this cigar is made up entirely of Nicaraguan long-fillers from 3 different growing regions - Ometepe, Jalapa, and Condega – that have been aged from five to eight years. The bourbon barrel aged binder is a Mexican San Andres leaf, and it’s all held together five-years aged Ecuadorian habano wrapper. The barrel aging produces a strong oaky flavor and hints of bourbon in the aroma. You’ll also notice some floral notes, spice and some sweetness in a medium-bodied format. In my many, many samplings of this cigar, the construction has been nothing short of flawless – something we’ve come to expect from AJ-made cigars. Grab a box of these unique Diesels today, pair ‘em with a few fingers of the good stuff, and you won’t be disappointed.\\xa0Good news! Diesel Whiskey Row has received a well-deserved 91-point rating, noting: \"The earthy, chocolate notes of this cigar frame a hearty core of wood and cedar, all combining for a finish of bread and brown sugar.\"',\n",

The Diesel Whiskey Row was released in 2018 to a wave of excitement from cigar aficionados everywhere, owing to the fantastic blend and bold flavors from the binder aged in Rabbit Hole bourbon barrels. The follow-up to that fantastic success uses barrels that originally contained 30-year old Pedro Ximenez Sherry which were sent to Rabbit Hole to produce their PX Sherry Finish Bourbon, before finally landing at Tabacalera AJ Fernandez in Nicaragua.The blend consists of a dark Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper and Nicaraguan fillers, but the barrel-aged Brazilian Arapiraca binder is the star of the show. The flavors are wonderfully influenced by the sherry casks, without becoming infused or overly sweet. Instead, you’ll find notes of dark fruit, cedar, chocolate, and pepper, for a smooth medium-bodied experience that pairs great with any drinks with naturally sweet characteristics.

As they say, no good deed goes unpunished. Here’s our punishment. Among some more decent brands was a gem labeled Don Jesus. Funny enough alone, but it gets better. Closer examination revealed the number of cigars on the bundle manually scribbled out with a Sharpie. Bearable, I guess. But it gets worse. The ‘Don Jesus’ label was obviously applied over another label to intentionally cover it up. Underneath? Another label of a brand called Desperado Seconds. A cigar described in print, on the sticker, by the manufacturer as, “These are not first quality cigars, not stemless, perfect, or spectacular in any way.” Good. Now that my cards are all on the table, here’s the happy ending. We burnt a bundle. They’re not that bad, and I want to wash my hands of this mess quickly.

Now, more than a decade after the original release, Don Lino Africa is being reimagined with a little help from AJ Fernandez.Made by hand at Tabacalera AJ Fernandez Cigars de Nicaragua S.A. in Esteli, the revamped Don Lino Africa blend starts with a hand-selected long-filler blend of Dominican Piloto and Nicaraguan leaves from Ometepe, Jalapa, and Esteli.

Grab a box and experience a blend inspired by one of the most beautiful places on Earth, the African Savanna.Good news!

The blend itself is no slouch, either - this cigar features the same blend as the original Don Tomas release, with just a few tweaks around the wrapper.Wrapped in a bold Connecticut Broadleaf overtop Connecticut Maduro binder and Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers, Don Tomas delivers tons of flavor without ever overwhelming. Toasting the foot, you'll find tons of charred wood, chocolate, black pepper, and a backing of natural tobacco sweetness - a combination that practically begs to be paired up with a few fingers of the good stuff. Sure, there's other brands out there today that are flashier than Don Tomas, but if you just want a solid cigar at a nice price... look no further.\",\n",

Now owned by General Cigar, the Don Tomas blend was reworked in 2005 in an effort to get back to the brands roots as a no-nonsense, hearty cigar for a fair price. Eliminating blended tobaccos from all over the world, the reworked blend is now back to the original Honduran and Nicaraguan tobaccos that put this brand on the map.Don Tomas Clasico features a combination of select long-fillers and supremely superb construction giving way for an easy draw and even burn. Crafted with a silky smooth wrapper and Nicaraguan and Honduran fillers, This Don Tomas cigar is surprisingly complex, with toasty, woody and slightly sweet flavors. With an unbelievably low price tag attached, the Don Tomas Clasico is a great choice for an everyday cigar.Good news, Don Tomas Clasico Natural, a 2006 Top 25 cigar has earned as high as a 90-rating, noting: “This cigar gives off an excellent toasty aroma as it burns.

Now, we welcome Herrera Esteli Brazilian Maduro with open arms.\\xa0It comes wrapped in a dark, plantation grown Brazilian Mata Fina wrapper – a leaf typically used as a binder or in the filler. Applied on top, it provides pronounced floral and earthy flavors. Underneath is a Connecticut Broadleaf binder and long-fillers from Nicaragua. Overall, it’s a medium to full-bodied cigar with great flavor. The original Herreras are a tough act to follow, but this one stacks very up nicely.\\xa0Good news! The Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Brazilian Maduro received an impressive 92-point rating, noting: “...malty, fruity qualities are beautifully showcased with each dense, chewy puff. Copious amounts of coffee bean also emerge before the earthy, slightly spicy finish.”',\n",

       "  'desc': 'Big Willy Style....Welcome Herrera Esteli cigars, the newest addition to join the ranks of Drew Estate\\'s massive portfolio. As with the Liga and Undercrown lines, Herrera Esteli further solidifies Drew Estate\\'s presence in non-infused, traditional cigars. This time, the story starts with Willy Herrera. He was a tobacco guru at the famed El Titan de Bronze factory in Miami, responsible for some of the most sought after and highly-rated handmades around. And once he combined forces with Drew Estate, he took like a duck to water. What you see here is the result of sampling and tweaking dozens upon dozens of blends, and the final process is as close to perfection as you can get.\\xa0From the vintage Cuban-esque bands to the cabinet style box, Herrera Esteli screams Cuba. And the glue sealing the whole thing together is the blend. Oh-so-creamy, yet highly representative of Cuban cigars of old. It\\'s got some oomph, but the flavors are delivered in such a velvety fashion the power is beautifully masked. Crisp, clean notes of spices, cedar, cream, and roasted nuts are the backbone, as occasional hints of white pepper and semi-sweet vanilla weave masterfully throughout. Initial puffs foreshadow a medium-bodied profile, but the slow burn begins to unveil a different story, as it inches toward a medium to full-bodied crescendo. If the Liga Privada series is a cup of black coffee, Herrera Esteli is without a doubt the \"with cream\" option. A handmade of the highest caliber, Herrera Esteli is going to turn some heads.In addition to multiple 93-ratings, Herrera Esteli received a well-deserved 94-rating as well as Top 25 honors for 2014, #8 overall. The panel noted: \"medium body, with notes of spice—both earthy and sweet—and a long, long finish.\"NOTE: This is the original, 94-rated \"Herrera Esteli\". Drew Estate has added \"Habano\" to the name to distinguish it from later Herrera Esteli releases.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'desc': 'More Herrera from MiamiDrew Estate has an impressive portfolio of cigars. From the infused ACID line to the traditional wares like Liga Privada and Undercrown, everything coming out of La Gran Fabrica Drew Estate in Nicaragua competes with the best in the industry. One of their finest cigars is without a doubt the 94-rated Herrera Esteli. In 2016 we saw an offshoot of the blend produced at master Blender Willy Herrera’s former factory, El Titan de Bronze, in Miami in a tasty Corona Gorda size. At the 2018 IPCPR show the blend went full scale releasing four new sizes.\\xa0The core of the blend consists of Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers that are bunched up entubar style – an old Cuban technique that is very labor intensive but provides a great draw. It’s all held together by leaves from Ecuador. A Sumatra-seed leaf is used for the binder while a dark Ecuador Habano Oscuro wrapper lays overtop, secured by a triple seam cap. It’s a smooth full-bodied blend with flavors sweet cedar, earth, and espresso. Whether you tried the original Corona Gorda or not, you should check out these new sizes. They’re only rolled by level 9 rollers from Cuba so you can count on high quality construction and the flavors are fantastic.\\xa0Good news! Herrera Esteli Miami has earned an impressive 93-point rating, noting: \"A toothy toro with the rich qualities of semi-sweet chocolate, cedar and almonds. Hints of orange peel add a pleasant pop of citrus to the espresso bean finish.\"',\n",

       "  'desc': 'Herrera Esteli’s sophomore effort lives up to the hype!Willy Herrera began his craft as a small manufacturer in Little Havana, Miami and his talents quickly landed him a job as Drew Estate’s master blender. Drafting off of the success of his first release under the Drew Estate umbrella, Herrera Esteli Norteno has finally arrived. This new release pays homage to Esteli, Nicaragua – the home of Drew Estate and Herrera Esteli. Norteno, meaning “northerners” in Spanish, was chosen as the name due to people from Esteli being referred to as ‘Nortenos.’This full-bodied firecracker is no joke, boasting long-fillers from the fertile Nicaraguan growing regions of Jalapa and Esteli, both known for producing bold n’ hearty tobaccos. A Honduran binder cloaks these leaves with an oily San Andres Maduro wrapper draped over top. This long-anticipated release delivers bold notes of pepper and chocolate that endure to the finish and are backed by hints of cashew, cocoa, and espresso. Powerful, ultra-flavorful, and satisfying to the last puff, the second Herrera is easily as good as the first. And if you’ve tried the original, you know that says a hell of a lot. Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Norteno landed at #7 on the 2016 Top 25 Cigar list and received a well-deserved 94-rating, noting: \"It’s also rich with notes of raw cocoa bean, refined milk chocolate and nougat, yet maintains its earthy qualities without becoming too sweet.\"\\u200bNOTE: Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Norteno has undergone a packaging update. They are now available in 25-count boxes and new sizes that reflect the same sizes as the rest of the Herrera Esteli line. The blend has not changed.\\xa0',\n",

But now this latest line extension to MUWAT has taken things to a whole new level, taste-wise. This phrase gets thrown around a lot, but this time it couldn’t be more accurate – you’ve never tasted anything like this before.The biggest difference with Kentucky Fire-Cured is the inclusion of – you guessed it! – American fire-cured tobacco leaves from Kentucky and Virginia. While normally tobacco is air-cured, these special leaves are left to hang in specially-constructed curing barns, a process that dates back more than 200 years and that imbues each leaf with a rich, smoky, slightly sweet flavor that boasts exceptional balance and uniqueness. Notes of oak, hickory, and maple-laced sweetness explode on the palate. These leaves are joined by Nicaraguan and Brazilian Mata Fina long-fillers along with an oily San Andres maduro wrapper. This finished product is like nothing else on the market. Been looking for a totally uncommon taste experience that’ll blow your hair back? You just found it. Want something really special?

Perfectly nestled beneath this extensively aged leaf awaits a 3-country blend of impressive long-fillers hailing from the Dominican, Nicaragua, and Honduras. This remarkable bouquet is tied together by a bold San Andres binder. Upon taking flame to foot, the real fireworks begin. A mellow barrage of chewy, soft notes coat the palate in striking fashion. Nutty, creamy, and slightly sweet, the 30-year inches toward a medium-bodied profile that only gets better with each satisfying and remarkable puff. Oh yes, epic indeed, this handmade should be savored....slowly.\",\n",

Made in true boutique fashion, each Graycliff cigar is composed of exquisite, patiently aged tobaccos and offers the highest standard in quality, taste, and satisfaction.Often compared to the beloved Ashton VSG, the Crystal Series is a bold, medium to full-bodied gem. Rated 90+ on more than one occasion, in addition to “Best of the Best” honors from Robb Report, this flavorful lovely combines a thick and oily Ecuadorian sun-grown wrapper with a complex mixture of supremely aged long-fillers from Brazil, Nicaragua, and Honduras. As an added bonus, a rare strain of Grecian tobacco was carefully blended into this cigar, adding a lovely spice to the fray. After significant box-aging, the Crystal Series blankets the palate with bold, yet elegant flavors, including leather, earth, pepper, and a sweet aftertaste that complements the cigar’s rich core perfectly.This just might be Graycliff’s most sophisticated handmade.The Graycliff Crystal received a well deserved \\'90\\' point rating, noting:\"A soft, oily pyramid with a loose, easy draw. It has earthy notes of honey, caramel and espresso, with a long spicy finish. A medium-bodied cigar that will improve with age.\"',\n",

Quality will never be sacrificed for price, and Gurkha cigars are worth every penny, and then some.Genghis Khan is yet another example of Gurkha\\'s expertise in uniqueness and craftsmanship. The Connecticut Broadleaf maduro wrapper used to complete this cigar is simply gorgeous. Aside from being one of the hardest leaves on the planet to harvest, let alone one of the most expensive, it delivers an assortment of rich, slightly sweet flavors and promotes a super-slow burn. The hearty blend of aged Dominican and Honduran tobaccos combine with rare leaves from India and Africa to create an array of smooth, earthy notes backed by subtle hints of pepper. A medium-bodied delight to be savored, courtesy of one of the finest brands in the business.\\'The Khan\\' is an alluring, 7.5\" x 52 Churchill size that\\'s masterfully blended and guarantees a satisfying and enjoyable experience. Such a masterpiece can only be presented as such. Packaged in a gloriously attractive dome chest that Genghis Khan himself would be proud to own. A big, bulky antique style, humidor quality dome that will sufficiently store 30 nicely proportioned churchills, complete with a lift-out tray that reveals a lower compartment for additional cigar or accessory storage. Once again, the folks behind Gurkha have outdone themselves with this piece.Gurkha Genghis Khan received a well-deserved 90-rating noting:\\xa0\"Imposingly large with a dark wrapper and even draw. The smoke is chewy and nutty carrying a subtle cocoa-powder sweetness.\"',\n",

Quietly and efficiently, Gurkha has become one of the top boutique brands in the land, creating some of the finest, most prestigious and sought after premium cigars in the world. They’re not cheap, but the best rarely is. To put it bluntly, Gurkha Legend Centurian is one of the best cigars in the Gurkha portfolio, hands down.\\nTheir formula is simple: use a well-balanced blend of the highest grade Dominican long-leaf filler available, add a slightly spicy premium authentic Cameroon binder leaf, followed by a Habano wrapper. The process however, is not so simple. Gurkha Cigars holds the highest of standards, and expects perfection and excellence out of every cigar created. In order to achieve these high standards, the Legend must patiently undergo an extensive aging process of 8 long years. After all is said and done, this gorgeous, dense cigar delivers a powerful, rich bouquet of hearty flavors in a uniquely smooth manner. Oozing with oily goodness, the medium to full-bodied Gurkha Legend is a well filled, slow burning beauty that will demand your attention from start to finish.Gurkha Legend received a well-deserved \\'90\\' rating, which commented: \"A very handsome, dark brown torpedo with a near perfect draw.

He took a liking to the island, and after establishing his business reputation, began making cigars a year later. The man’s name was Herman Upmann, and he named the brand he developed after himself. H. Upmann remains a prominent name in cigar shops more than 175 years later, and the newest H. Upmann cigar not only pays tribute to this great man but is also crafted as a modern take on those original Upmann cigars from way back in 1844.For the blend, an Ecuador-grown Habano wrapper leaf covers a Dominican binder and long-fillers from the Dominican and the Condega & Esteli regions of Nicaragua. This decidedly modern mix of tobaccos produces a classic, wood-forward profile with ample complexity and undertones of spice, cocoa, and cinnamon that hearkens back to the taste of cigars from yesteryear. Now don your top hat & double-breasted vest, grab a box of Herman’s Batch, and be the first on your block to light up like a 19th-century socialite.',\n",

Some say that the name of the game these days is boutique. Plenty of connoisseurs almost hesitate to try cigars with name recognition, because everyone seems to be focused on the one-offs and the rare stuff. But despite these trends (that always come and go), there are a few brands that have always been there for us. Hoyo de Monterrey is one of those brands, delighting cigar fans for more than 150 years. How could you beat that track record? The answer: You don’t. You honor it properly with an ICON release.With this single-size 5.5” x 49 robusto, Hoyo de Monterrey becomes the third cigar brand to be honored with an ICON release, joining Macanudo and Punch in this exclusive club. You can join in on the festivities too, and the cost of admission is just one of these phenomenal cigars. The first thing you’ll notice is the gorgeous Corojo wrapper, a tribute to the kind Jose Gener grew in Cuba when the name was registered way back in 1865. This sits atop a Dominican binder and filler, and provides a toasty, Cuban-esque accent to the mellow-medium bodied notes of cream, nuts, and cedar. A touch of pepper guarantees this is a blend that won’t make you yawn, and the excellent construction ensures you won’t have to put them down until you’re burning your fingers. The past is very strong for Hoyo, but the future is even brighter. Grab a box of Hoyo ICON, and raise a glass to another 150 years.',\n",

And it’s well deserved! I mean, hell, when you mix two winners together, it’s hard to get anything besides A+ results. Called “La Amistad,” the Hoyo/AJ Fernandez collaboration has seen a release at the annual trade show the last two years, and this year doesn’t buck the trend: today, CI presents Hoyo La Amistad Black.\\xa0Blended by A.J. Fernandez and hand rolled at his factory in Esteli, Nicaragua, each Hoyo La Amistad Black is a dark and enchanting treat. Featuring an oily, thick Ecuadorian Sumatra Oscuro wrapper, La Amistad Black is a full-bodied, spicy firecracker, featuring notes of cayenne pepper and black pepper, in addition to cinnamon and leather. It stays complex down to the end, thanks to the intricately blended and bunched Nicaraguan long-fillers… in all, this is probably the fullest-bodied, most flavorful Hoyo offering to date making it more than easy to recommend.',\n",

On the original, you’ll find a Connecticut tip that’ll lend a subtle, tea-like sweetness to the cigar… cut it further down, under the Connecticut tip, and you’ll find a richer, chocolatey profile. For the maduro, the cigar stays the same, just swapping out a darker, richer wrapper leaf that provides a fuller-bodied profile.\\xa0',\n",

Quite a one-two combo, to say the least, and boy does this cigar pack a punch, not in strength, but in flavor. Java is a subtly sweet Nicaraguan that features a dark, oily maduro wrapper stretched across an aged blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers. While aging, these cigars have been slowly infused with the delicious flavor of gourmet mocha, morphing a traditional Nicaraguan cigar into an incredibly rich cigar that burns smooth from start to finish, leaving an extremely pleasant aroma in its wake.What's this 'Latte' all about, you ask? The Java Latte employs a silky-smooth Connecticut Ecuador wrapper rather than the standard Connecticut Broadleaf. The result is a mellow and creamy sensation with all that Java awesomeness you've come to love.Note: The Wafe size is a flat-pressed cigar that measures roughly one-third of an inch thick when laid flat.\\xa0\",\n",

The sizes range from a chunky 4.7\"x 52 robusto all the way up to an incredible 8x80 belicoso, and all are blended to perfection with a silky Ecuador Habano wrapper and Nicaraguan binder & fillers. Produced at Aganorsa Leaf in Nicaragua, and chock full of Aganorsa goodness, you know these are the real deal. Exploding with notes of roasted nuts, earth, toast and coffee, these sticks are just as big in flavor as they are in size. The JFR Lunatic is an experience, one you’d be a lunatic to pass up.Good news!

Today, Joya de Nicaragua lends us a hand in answering this age old question, with the release of Antano Gran Reserva. Modeled after their flagship Antano line, Gran Reserva is a similar blend, with the addition of aged tobaccos to provide a more “mature” experience.\\xa0Manufactured at Joya de Nicaragua’s operation in Esteli, Nicaragua, Joya de Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva is a Nicaraguan puro of the highest caliber. To set this one apart from its peers, Juan Martinez (Executive President of JdN), called for the addition of five-year-aged filler leaves to the mix and applied a rich and oily Corojo wrapper on top. The result is markedly different from the regular Antano: what was once a powerful, unabashed beast has been tamed, offering a much smoother ride. There’s still hits of black pepper up front, but they’re quickly joined by natural, sugary sweetness, nutty notes, and dry chocolate.\\xa0Good News! Joya De Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva has been awarded as the #16 best cigar of 2018 and earned an awesome 93-point rating, noting: \"this attractive cigar has a pleasantly toasty core that\\'s elevated by hints of saffron, hickory wood and chocolate.

Like brave knights coming to battle a fearsome dragon, many enthusiasts have entered the fray confident, only to be quickly tamed by bold, powerful profiles. I\\'ve seen it all too many times. We even had a guy pass out while using the facilities at one of our stores....he was puffing on it like a locomotive stuck on overdrive. Luckily, after about a 5 minute tile nap, he exited with just a bruised ego. He, like many before him, learned that Joya de Nicaragua makes one hell of a full-bodied cigar. But now, Joya de Nicaragua dials the strength down a bit for a cigar that\\'s built for daily enjoyment. Without any further delay welcome, JOYA Red.\\xa0Many of Joya de Nicaragua\\'s handmades rely on potent ligeros to deliver their feisty bouquet. This time, lower tobacco primings were chosen to impart the same core flavors, but in a much more palatable fashion. Long-fillers from the uber-fertile regions of Esteli, Condega, and Jalapa, were stuffed into a golden hued Nicaraguan Habano wrapper. This recipe yielded a medium-bodied bouquet boasting strong doses of roasted nuts and pepper, as hints of leather, toast, and coffee also enter the fray. In a nutshell, JOYA Red is going to appeal to fans of Joya de Nicaragua, as well as newcomers of all shapes and sizes. Heck, even those still licking their wounds should thoroughly enjoy this one.\\xa0JOYA Red received a well-deserved \\'90\\' rating noting:\\xa0\"The lush draw of this cigar delivers a strong black pepper character that settles down to show notes of hickory, brown sugar and earth.\"\\xa0',\n",

Newman’s top-selling cigar was a little brand known as “Judge Wright.” Back then, the line had a simple slogan, “A fair trial will give a verdict in favor of this cigar.” Now, I’ve got to be honest. My experience with any sort of court is limited to Judge Judy and Law and Order reruns. However, if I were a judge, I’d throw anyone who didn’t like this cigar out, as they must be insane. This cigar is a straight up value, and I’d recommend getting in early and often. Judge Wright is a Nicaraguan puro with a Sun Grown wrapper, but unlike some similar blends, this one stays smooth and medium-bodied throughout. The ‘Cuban sandwich’ blend has great flavors of earth, leather, and slight spice. There’s nothing else I can say here, Judge Wright is a great everyday cigar. Case dismissed. \\u200b',\n",

Born in Spain, Litto gives a nod to his homeland with arguably the best release to ever come out of the La Flor Dominicana camp (and that’s saying a whole lot), dubbed Andalusian Bull. Striking in its appearance, the Bull gets its unique, old-school shape from a long-since-retired cigar mold that Gomez tracked down in Belgium. Coming in one size only, a rustic-looking figurado, this gem takes you back to the golden age of cigars.A beautiful, reddish-hued Ecuadorian Corojo wrapper is first to grab your attention. (There have been very few times I knew a cigar was going to rock my world just by looking at it…this was one of those occasions.) Potent Dominican filler tobaccos including Criollo ’98 and Pelo d’Oro are hugged by a Dominican binder. The unique figurado shape lends itself to a truly complex experience. The thickest part of the Bull is at the foot of the cigar, and introduces a myriad of flavors from the get-go. Caramel, leather, and a tinge of milk chocolate kick things off, with notes of sweet spice, rich red pepper, and slight citrus nuances entering the fray as the ring gauge gradually decreases. In this case, I’m happy to report this sucker deserves its #1 Cigar of the Year honors and then some, get ‘em the very first chance you get!La Flor Dominicana was awarded with #1 Cigar of 2016 honors and a well-deserved 96-rating! Here’s what the experts had to say,\\xa0“First impressions are bold and savory with strong notes of hickory and leather. But it continues to take on a complex spiciness of saffron and cumin as well as a slight tangy note that brings the strength and spice together quite gracefully—and it only gets better with every puff.”Note: As a result of Andalusian Bull's recent praise and honors, the factory is experiencing an extended backlog. At this point, lead times on filling new customer backorders may be up to 1 year. Due to the extended delay, we will not be accepting any further backorders until production increases. We apologize for the inconvenience and will update this message if new information becomes available.\\xa0\\u200b\",\n",

The blends are incredibly full-flavored and packed to the gills with ligero, with a nice smooth flavor to back them all up. Litto Gomez and his team at LFD are certified Dominican Tobacco Geniuses, with each blend being better than the last. La Nox is the prime example of this, with more industry awards heaped upon it than you can shake a stick at.With a dark and oily Brazilian Maduro wrapper, a Mexican San Andres binder, and the classic LFD Dominican ligero long-fillers, La Nox is certainly potent. There’s some weight to this one in the hand, and it shows in the smoke: you can easily get 90+ minutes from the Toro.

Sure, there’s tons of awesome handmades coming from this island, but none quite as iconic or flavorful as La Flor Dominicana. While the blends are incredibly varied, there is one thing in common: LFD’s got kick. Like, championship level kick-boxing strength behind it. It all comes from their generous use of ligero long-fillers, and in the cigars at hand today, that leaf takes center-stage. If you’re not a fan of full-bodied cigars, I’d suggest taking yourself elsewhere post-haste. But if you want a boutique boomstick that’ll demand your taste bud’s full attention, stand up. LFD Ligero has an awesome pre-light aroma, and after toasting it you’ll find a spice that grows in flavor and intensity down to the nub. Earthiness and the natural sweetness of Dominican tobacco make an appearance too. Jump in on this jalapeno, and you won’t be disappointed.

And that skill is on full display in the La Flor Dominicana Reserva series.

The Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper shows off a creamy note and some hints of natural tobacco, backed up by slight spice, and a cool earthiness. Want to talk construction?

La Galera 1936 Box Pressed cigars were released in 2016, but the planning for these cigars first started 7 years prior.\\xa0When Jochy decided he was going to create a premium line of cigars of his own, he took some of the finest tobaccos he had grown on his La Canela farms and set them aside to age for 7 years. These were Piloto Cubano and Criollo 98 leaves that are used in the filler and another Criollo 98 as the binder. To finish the blend off he applied a smooth Ecuador Habano wrapper on top. The blend is medium to full in body, with a ton of great flavor. Notes of cocoa, pepper, dried fruit, espresso, and earth make for a satisfying complexity. It’s hard to find cigars of this quality in this price range, try out a fiver and I’m sure you’ll be back for a box.\\xa0Good news!

And the tobaccos used are just as good. La Galera only uses proprietary, aged tobaccos grown on Jochy’s farms in the Cibao Valley, with the only exception for wrapper leaf. In this case, an Ecuador Habano wrapper is applied atop a Dominican Corojo binder and Piloto Cubano, Criollo 98, and Pelo de Oro long-fillers. It falls in the medium-bodied spectrum but is full on flavor, with heavy notes of pepper, some earth, wood, and a touch of fruity sweetness.

At the IPCPR 2018 show, La Gloria Cubana released La Gloria Cubana Esteli – a modern interpretation of the classic La Gloria Cubana blend. What does modern mean in cigar terms? That’s easy. Full-bodied, full-flavored, Nicaraguan, and ligero wrapped.LGC Esteli delivers bold profile with Nicaraguan spirit, thanks to a deep brown ligero wrapper from Nicaragua’s rich Jalapa Valley. Underneath, a Honduran leaf binds a blend of Honduran seco and ligero long-fillers grown in two different regions. The end result is a complex medium to full-bodied cigar with notes of cedar, spice and white pepper. Full of flavor and expertly crafted, La Glora Cubana Esteli is sure to keep the LGC trend of high ratings rolling.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

Instead of using molds to press cigars before placing them in a box, the box-press was achieved by simply placing cigars in specially-sized boxes that would apply even pressure to the cigars, resulting in a more even box-press that eliminated air pockets and guaranteed an excellent draw. This was known as a “Spanish Press”, and the Spanish Press by La Gloria Cubana is the perfect tribute to this classic style.The La Gloria Cubana Sapnish Press features a toothy Nicaraguan Jalapa wrapper, brimming with flavors that perfectly compliment the San Andres binder and tri-country filler blend consisting of Nicaraguan Jalapa, Dominican Piloto Cubano, Dominican Olor, and Brazilian Mata Fina tobacco. Along with a great draw and smoke production, you’ll find spicy earthiness and notes of cedar and toast. This release is an excellent addition to La Gloria Cubana’s portfolio, and a terrific way to honor the roots of an important genre of cigars. Grab a box of La Gloria Cubana Spanish Press, and light up old-world Cuba style.\\xa0Note: La Gloria Cubana recently underwent a packaging update.

From time to time I stumble upon a fantastic new cigar and find it hard to contain my excitement. I\\'m genuinely excited about it. See, I\\'m a cigar lunatic who burns through a half dozen cigars on light days, so I get very excited when a special cigar like La Herencia Cubana arrives on the scene. This is a legit, thoroughly delectable cigar. The wrapper is a dark, toothy, leathery-looking Ecuadorian Sumatra leaf that\\'s responsible for delivering much of the intense, rich flavory goodness. The fillers are a well-balanced collection of long-leaf tobaccos from three of the major growing regions in Nicaragua: Jalapa, Condega, and Esteli. The flavor is medium to full in body and begins with a burst of black pepper, a feisty opening that\\'s tamed by a rich yet smooth core of tobacco flavors and underlying creaminess that\\'s present right on through to the cigar\\'s conclusion. Its hearty bouquet is coupled with toasty, woodsy notes and a long-lasting, peppery aftertaste. Fans of unique and \\'boutique\\' blends, I urge you to take me up on this one. As you know, we\\'ve got a generous return policy - so you\\'ve got nothing to lose and a whole lot to gain - especially for just over 3 bucks per cigar here at CI.Note: La Herencia Cubana recently underwent a packaging update.

They have been a staple in humidors across the country ever since – praised for smooth, well rounded blends that create cigars of true elegance and finesse. In 2016, La Palina hit the ICPCR show locked and loaded with some fantastic new blends and a new logo, proving they are still one of the premier cigar manufacturers in the business. One of the newest releases, La Palina Nicaragua Connecticut, enters the scene filling a void in the brands portfolio.La Palina has released cigars from almost every major region, but this collaboration with AJ Fernandez is the first from Nicaragua. The Nicaragua Connecticut comes wrapped in an Ecuadorian Connecticut Shade leaf – another first for La Palina. The binder and filler tobaccos are both cultivated in the rich soils of Nicaragua. The overall experience is mellow to medium-bodied, boasting rich and creamy flavors with hints of earth, pepper and roasted nuts. We’ve been waiting for a Nicaraguan from La Palina for years now.

The profile? Medium-bodied with hints of leather. Dark chocolate and oak join the mix as the cigar progresses. La Palina has been releasing a bevy of exciting new blends over the past year, that’s for sure. And Nicaraguan Oscuro might just be the best of the bunch.Good news!

Can't change, don't wanna change, will never change....so here's round #2,574. The brand new LPH Habano is yours starting at a paltry buck-seventy-five apiece.LPH Cazadores by La Perla Habana is bred for everyday enjoyment and, of course, rich Cuban-esque flavor. Crafted with a top-grade Habano Criollo wrapper leaf and an aged 'Cuban Sandwich' blend of Nicaraguan and Dominican tobaccos, this medium-bodied blend offers flavor in droves. Notes of cedar, rich tobacco, pepper, earth, and nuts are present before a delicious, slightly sweet finish. It's tasty, no doubt.

It sold so well that the Newman's decided to award this fan-favorite blend with a packaging update, and in 2010 after nearly 25 years in circulation, La Unica finally received the box packaging that it always deserved.Manufactured at Tabacalera A.

       "  'desc': 'A handsome Honduran handmadeYou may have heard of Leaf by Oscar for their clever packaging — each cigar is wrapped in a raw tobacco leaf after it’s done being rolled. But if you’ve never tried one, let me assure you: this is not just a marketing gimmick! The tobacco perfectly encloses each cigar, protecting it from any sort of damage in the same way that cellophane would. Unwrap the leaf, and you’ll find a flawless presentation underneath.\\xa0For the Sumatra version of this fan-favorite boutique brand, blend master Oscar Valladares utilized a, you-guessed-it, Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper overtop the usual Honduran binder and long-filler. Coming in just a tad above medium-bodied, Leaf by Oscar Sumatra delivers a full-flavored mixture of natural tobacco, citrus, and black and white pepper. It’s a most worthy addition to their portfolio, and one I can easily recommend to any lover of boutique cigars.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'desc': 'Get Inspired. Get Macanudo.\\xa0Macanudo has been around longer than most of us having been enjoying cigars, and for good reason. With its roots in Havana, Cuba, this decades old brand is the gold standard for consistency and excellence — especially if you love mellower blends. But a few years back, a new contender from Macanudo entered the ring: the Inspirado line. If Macanudo Café is made for the everyday cigar lover, Inspirado is made for the true cigar aficionado. That’s why today we’re more than happy to welcome the newest addition to the brand: Macanudo Inspirado Red.\\xa0Before you dive into this one, let me give you a little advice: this ain’t your daddy’s Macanudo. Inspirado Red is a full-bodied flavor bomb, possibly the strongest blend to ever wear the Macanudo name. Born from the rich, volcanic soils of Nicaragua, Red features an Ecuadorian wrapper leaf, complemented by Nicaraguan binder and Nicaraguan and Honduran long-fillers. Each puff reveals loads of dark fruit, red pepper, hints of cedar, and slight notes of leather. Complex, delicious, and affordable, Inspirado Red is an absolute must-have.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'desc': 'The White-out is comingMacanudo has never been a brand that pushed any sort of story, gimmicks, or crazy marketing gestures. And they’ve been doing just fine. Indeed, this brand has been at the top of the sales charts for as long as I can remember, with no artificial fanfare or hype — they’ve simply remained true to the tenets of crafting a great cigar. Today, though, I’d like to break tradition a bit to discuss Macanudo Inspirado White — a cigar too complex and delicious to not dive in deep on.\\xa0Inspirado White is a study in contrasts. It’s simple, yet complex. It’s sweet, but spicy. It’s elegant and refined, but doesn’t carry a top-shelf price tag. Perhaps it’s the aged tobacco inside each and every perfectly wrapped specimen here that delivers so much. The golden, silky Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper is aged for 6 years; the Nicaraguan and Mexican San Andres filler leaves are aged for four. The draw is perfect on every sample I’ve got my hands on, producing a smattering of earth, slight spice, soft and creamy notes, and a warm tobacco core. My new favorite Macanudo, you owe it to yourself to try Inspirado White as soon as possible.\\xa0',\n",

After years absorbing knowledge, Abdel moved to Nicaragua 6 years ago and began building what is now emerging as one of the finest boutique makers in the country.Of all the cigars made in his factory – ITC 10th Anniversary, Padilla Habano, Rocky Patel Fusion – Abdel considers the Man O’ War his finest creation. Each expertly made cigar is a sight to behold. The dark Habano Ecuador wrapper is beautiful...thick, smooth, and covered with natural oils. This thing is stunning, positively gorgeous. But underneath the velvet glove is a hammer, a robust medium-full recipe of aged Cuban-seed Nicaraguan long-fillers which unleashes a bold bouquet for the senses. The opening is robust, with heavy spice and wood undertones, developing a chewy, velvety-smooth core of oak and earth which coats the palate, leaving behind a sweet array of spices. A variety of understated nuances come and go throughout the burn, including coffee, cocoa bean, and a touch of vanilla. Man O\\' War is simply incredible. I mean it. The packaging for Man O’ War is suitably impressive, a presentation to match the quality of the cigar itself. 22 Man O\\' War cigars snugly packed in a unique, heavy cedar chest.',\n",

Each Man O’ War release has left fans clamoring for more and established AJ as one of the best cigar makers around. In the decade since Man O’ War was introduced, AJ has gone on to win numerous awards, including Cigar Aficionado’s #1 Cigar of the Year in 2019. But with Valkyrie, Fernandez proved he’s not slowing down.\\xa0Man O’ War Valkyrie uses an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper leaf that’s known as a “Desflorado.” While the tobacco is growing, AJ removes the flower and the upper portion of the plant, allowing the leaves that remain to absorb all the sunlight and nutrients. The result is a flavor like no other. Coffee, light pepper, cedar, and cream combine together to create a masterpiece of a cigar you have to taste to believe. Mellow enough to be your first cigar of the day, and flavorful enough to be your last, any AJ fan worth their salt needs to add this stunner to their humidor stat.\\xa0',\n",

This is the second time this fantastic cigar has hit the market, and it went quick the first time around. Act fast, and make sure you don’t miss out on this one of a kind experience.\\xa0',\n",

       "  'desc': 'Montecristo and Plasencia, a match made in heaven.The story of Montecristo Espada is seriously interesting. Not long ago, Montecristo and famed tobacco grower and cigar maker Nestor Plasencia struck a deal. This deal would gave Montecristo’s blending team, known as the ‘Grupo de Maestros,’ unrestricted access to Plasencia’s world-renowned library of tobaccos and state of the art factory. There, the Grupo de Maestro’s went to work, spending months creating the perfect blend. A blend that’s unlike any other Montecristo ever before. A Nicaraguan puro that’s overflowing with flavor. A cigar that’s as near perfect as they come. A cigar that’s easily fitting of the Montecristo name, but with a level of flavor that’s surprising and welcomed. In short, Montecristo Espada is exceptional. Meaning ‘sword,’ Espada makes full use of Plasencia’s unique tobacco archive and employs a gorgeous Habano wrapper from 2010 grown in Jalapa, Nicaragua. Underneath, an all-Nicaraguan blend of bold, well-aged long-fillers from Jalapa, Ometepe, and Condega were each specifically selected for their strength, flavor, or body. The result is an extremely well-balanced, layered with rich, hearty notes of wood, pepper, coffee, cream, nuts, and sweetness. Elegant, refined, and loaded with complexity, Montecristo Espada is truly a world-class cigar. Montecristo Espada received Top 25 honors for 2015 (#20 overall) and a well-deserved 92-rating noting:\\xa0\" offering the spice of a gingersnap with touches of cinnamon that build to a sweet, spicy finish.\"',\n",

The deal gave them unlimited access to all the Plasencia’s finest leaves, and the resulting cigar was known as the Montecristo Espada. The success of the original was so undeniable, the Grupo de Maestros once again scoured Plasencia’s stock to create a follow-up that ups the ante even on the first nearly-perfect blend: The Montecristo Espada Oscuro.The Espada Oscuro replaces the 2010 Jalapa Habano wrapper with a vintage Habano Rosado Oscuro leaf, that’s several shades darker and a fair bit stronger. The all-Nicaraguan components work together to produce an intriguing mélange of complex flavors, and rich, peppery notes of earth and leather. Espada is Spanish for sword, and the Grupo de Maestros were razor-sharp when they blended this gem.

       "  'desc': \"Saka's Crowning Achievement.Oh boy, this is it. The pinnacle of Steve Saka's blending talents. If you're looking for a budget-priced knockaround stick, keep looking, my friend. But if you want to treat yourself, and you're looking for one of the finest cigars money can buy, your search is over. The Muestra de Saka Unicorn is the result of an experiment by Saka to see what would happen if no expense or effort whatsoever was spared in the creation of an ultra-premium limited-release cigar. The $100 per cigar price tag may sound a little steep, but once you get one of these beauties in your hand, you won't regret a single penny.For the blend, Saka sorted through 6000 pounds of Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper and Nicaraguan filler, with only one percent being deemed high enough quality to make it into the finished product. The double perfecto shape was achieved by hardwood molds hand-cut by Saka himself, and production of the cigars themselves was entrusted to just one buncher-roller duo in the entire factory. Its rare that a cigar with such a high price point has a flavor profile good enough to match, but the Muestra de Saka Unicorn delivers in spades. pumping out an unbelievably complex yet medium-bodied profile with notes of cocoa, espresso, and a pleasant caramel sweetness supporting a core of roasted nuts, fresh-baked bread, and a touch of black pepper. The cost of admission is high, but with production limited to just 1000 cigars, you'll be kicking yourself if you miss your chance to pick yourself up a true Unicorn.Click Here to view the rest of the Dunbarton Tobacco & Trust portfolio\",\n",

       "  'desc': 'Nat Sherman has been a pillar in the cigar industry since 1930, but recently they’ve been hotter than ever. To commemorate their history (and their success), they’ve decided to re-release a formerly retired brand that was their first offering in the premium cigar market: Nat Sherman Epoca.\\xa0Handcrafted in the Dominican Republic by the Quesada family, Nat Sherman Epoca employs a vintage blend of Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers paired with a silky, golden-brown Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper. This combination promotes a blend that’s smooth and creamy, but still rich with flavors of coffee, nuts, wood, and pepper. Delicious and highly-enjoyable, this high-end offering accomplishes exactly what it set out to do: pay tribute to the pre-embargo clear Havana blend for which it was named and recreate some of that experience.\\xa0',\n",

They got their start in New York City all the way back in 1930, and they’re still slingin’ fine stogies today, nearly 90 years later. Their track record speaks for itself, as does their commitment to producing only the finest products worthy of bearing the family name. This is evident in all of their creations, and the newest name to join this illustrious portfolio is certainly no exception.The Nat Sherman Epoca Reserva is the first line extension of the Epoca, and goes against the grain of their usual releases. While most of their portfolio falls in the mellow-medium category, the Epoca Reserva sits at a heavy medium-full. This is due to a bold blend of Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers beneath a Dominican binder and wrapper, all selected to provide strength without sacrificing a bit of smoothness or taste.\\xa0',\n",

A very limited production item – when they’re in stock, act expeditiously.\\xa0',\n",

The size listing is stacked – a slew of big-ring vitolas, figurados, and more. The blend is dark, meaty, and enticing, delivering a wealth of dense tobacco flavor in an unconventional format. Packed in chunky, Spanish cedar boxes, Obsidian’s most remarkable trait is the price. Premium quality and memorable flavor, all for a fee that’s most similar to an ordinary yard ‘gar. Literally, they would be a bargain at twice the price.\\xa0So what’s in this meaty porterhouse? Obsidian employs a dark, oily Brazilian Habano ligero wrapper overtop a bold blend of Cuban-seed long-fillers from Nicaragua and the Dominican, secured inside a spicy Criollo ’98 binder. The result is a densely rich and chewy blend, loaded with complex notes of espresso, pepper, earth, toast, and cream. Full-bodied, but extremely smooth and balanced, Obsidian is thoroughly satisfying.\",\n",

Normally, these cigars have been privately reserved for ‘family use’ only.

Amazing things....amazing things dubbed Saison by Oliva.Saison by Oliva is the latest addition to their growing arsenal of standout Nicaraguan handmades. To create this blend, a silky, dark brown Ecuadorian Habano wrapper was paired with a rich combination of long-fillers from Oliva’s farms in Somoto, Esteli, and Condega, Nicaragua - all harvested in the same crop year. This vintage ensemble is ripe with flavor, delivering a big, booming Nicaraguan personality that’s notably refined and well-balanced. Notes of leather, oak, pepper, earth, coffee, and a slight twang on the finish offer a perfect interplay and coat the palate with proficiency. It’s medium to full-bodied at its peak, but the density of flavor can hold its own against even the fullest of them. In a nutshell, this new handmade from Oliva has charm, character, and ample flavor. \\u200b',\n",

Pristine Nicaraguan long-fillers are tucked beneath a chewy, dark chocolate-colored Broadleaf maduro wrapper.

Thanks to decades of communism and the exodus of cigar making talent, the best cigars being made today come from outside Cuba. But in their heyday, Cuban cigars were the pinnacle of the cigar maker’s art. Those that remember the legendary, authentic Cuban cigars know that they tasted sort of like vanilla ice cream soda. And about halfway through, you’d get a bit light-headed and realize that these babies were potent – but you’d notice it more in the belly than in the palate. “Original” Cubans bring back that incredible taste. Made in the Dominican Republic, these beauties offer a perfect draw and sweet, smooth power that pleases the palate, all while tricking the belly into thinking these are the real deal. Covered in a gorgeous Ecuadorian Sun-Grown (ESG) wrapper leaf, you will fall in love with these cigars!\"Original\" Cubans - a time machine back to pre-Castro Havana.',\n",

The flavorful bouquet includes heavy doses of toasty earthiness served up in a rich but ultimately smooth fashion. The aftertaste is long and pleasant, featuring an enjoyable sweetness that relaxes your palate. The presentation is terrific: nestled inside an attractive, dark, Spanish cedar box, each cigar is handsomely dressed in cedar sleeves.
