Cask strength refers to whiskies that are undiluted, usually creating a powerful bottling strength, high alcohol content, and ample character. That was the inspiration for 5 Vegas Cask-Strength and the blend lives up to the name....and then some.Hailing from Esteli, the cigar-making capital of Nicaragua, 5 Vegas Cask-Strength will captivate you from the get-go. Dressed in a stunning, reddish-hued Corojo wrapper from Nicaragua - one that’s dark and oozing with oils - this 6\"x52 Toro is lovingly box-pressed for maximum flavor. Beneath this exquisite wrapper, a bold combination of aged ligeros from Nicaragua, Honduras, and beyond has been expertly blended. Cask-Strength opens with a feisty bouquet loaded with hearty spices. An eventful opening indeed - which prepares the palate for a deep series of oak, cedar, earth, and toast. Spicy throughout with a warm, toasty aroma, expect a full-bodied and full-flavored crescendo as you gradually approach the nub. Marvelous!Cask-Strength is also available in a 6\"x60 Firkin size - with loads of extra flavor and body, this cigar is perfect for those who love big-ring value.</td>\n",

And now, without further delay, enter 1876 Reserve Maduro. That's right, the fan-favorite 1876 Reserve now comes draped in a dark, juicy maduro wrapper leaf. The profile is still relatively tame, yet the darker, richer leaf adds a welcomed layer of complexity. And better yet, the price is exactly the same, right around two bucks apiece. I don't like taking credit when it's not due, but I definitely deserve a pat on the back for this one. Well-made Dominican lovelies stuffed with aged Dominican long-fillers and sporting a toothy maduro wrapper, all for pennies on the dollar. You can put this one at the top of the list for best damn value around.    \n",

       "4  A luxurious encore presentation.The term ’cask strength’ is a term single-malt scotch and malt whisky enthusiasts are familiar with. Cask strength refers to whiskies that are undiluted, usually creating a powerful bottling strength, high alcohol content, and ample character. That was the inspiration for 5 Vegas Cask-Strength and the blend lives up to the name....and then some.Hailing from Esteli, the cigar-making capital of Nicaragua, 5 Vegas Cask-Strength will captivate you from the get-go. Dressed in a stunning, reddish-hued Corojo wrapper from Nicaragua - one that’s dark and oozing with oils - this 6\"x52 Toro is lovingly box-pressed for maximum flavor. Beneath this exquisite wrapper, a bold combination of aged ligeros from Nicaragua, Honduras, and beyond has been expertly blended. Cask-Strength opens with a feisty bouquet loaded with hearty spices. An eventful opening indeed - which prepares the palate for a deep series of oak, cedar, earth, and toast. Spicy throughout with a warm, toasty aroma, expect a full-bodied and full-flavored crescendo as you gradually approach the nub. Marvelous!Cask-Strength is also available in a 6\"x60 Firkin size - with loads of extra flavor and body, this cigar is perfect for those who love big-ring value.   \n",

I’m guessing the manufacturer either drank too much Dominican rum or his abacus was busted. Don’t get me wrong, I certainly ain’t complaining because I think under normal circumstances it would’ve cost me twice as much to buy what I bought (I better remove his name from the mailing list so he doesn’t see this later). What I do know is that this is an incredibly mellow Dominican cigar that’s well worth our ridiculous 2-fer price. In fact, the buy-in here starts under two bucks apiece! Is that too cheap? Maybe it’s me that’s getting soft in the head. Oh well, if you like easy going cigars, you’ll love this deal.\n",

And now, without further delay, enter 1876 Reserve Maduro. That's right, the fan-favorite 1876 Reserve now comes draped in a dark, juicy maduro wrapper leaf. The profile is still relatively tame, yet the darker, richer leaf adds a welcomed layer of complexity. And better yet, the price is exactly the same, right around two bucks apiece. I don't like taking credit when it's not due, but I definitely deserve a pat on the back for this one. Well-made Dominican lovelies stuffed with aged Dominican long-fillers and sporting a toothy maduro wrapper, all for pennies on the dollar. You can put this one at the top of the list for best damn value around. \n",

On paper, this cigar shouldn’t work. It’s just a collection of 9 cigars, packaged in three rows of three, that each come in aluminum tubes. But the secret to this one is in the sauce! Handmade by the folks behind the famed Davidoff brand, 3x3 tubos are produced in the Dominican Republic and feature a silky-smooth Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper leaf. Underneath, you’ll find Dominican binder and long-fillers, delivering a toasty, earthy, slightly spicy profile with a smooth finish you’ll certainly love.\n",

No, really. These suckers are HUGE. With each size weighing in at a hefty 60-ring gauge, these flavorful heavyweights are the all-you-can-eat buffet of the cigar world. And they're bulked up to contain that massive amount of flavor you'd expect from a 5 Vegas brand. Featuring a silky-smooth Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, these gems are packed to the gills with Habano tobaccos from Jalapa, Ometepe, Condega, and a pinch of ligeros from Esteli. This medium-bodied behemoth hits the spot with rich notes of earth, cedar, and a smooth finish with just a few touches of soft baking spices. Indeed, 5 Vegas delivers another home run here, ladies and gentleman. But what else would you expect from this industry classic that consistently churns out top-notch sticks at working man prices? \n",
       "5 Vegas Cask-Strength  A luxurious encore presentation.The term ’cask strength’ is a term single-malt scotch and malt whisky enthusiasts are familiar with. Cask strength refers to whiskies that are undiluted, usually creating a powerful bottling strength, high alcohol content, and ample character. That was the inspiration for 5 Vegas Cask-Strength and the blend lives up to the name....and then some.Hailing from Esteli, the cigar-making capital of Nicaragua, 5 Vegas Cask-Strength will captivate you from the get-go. Dressed in a stunning, reddish-hued Corojo wrapper from Nicaragua - one that’s dark and oozing with oils - this 6\"x52 Toro is lovingly box-pressed for maximum flavor. Beneath this exquisite wrapper, a bold combination of aged ligeros from Nicaragua, Honduras, and beyond has been expertly blended. Cask-Strength opens with a feisty bouquet loaded with hearty spices. An eventful opening indeed - which prepares the palate for a deep series of oak, cedar, earth, and toast. Spicy throughout with a warm, toasty aroma, expect a full-bodied and full-flavored crescendo as you gradually approach the nub. Marvelous!Cask-Strength is also available in a 6\"x60 Firkin size - with loads of extra flavor and body, this cigar is perfect for those who love big-ring value."

       "      <td>Even gramps would be proud.On a trip to factories in the Dominican Republic some time ago, I was offered a boatload of a really nice, smooth handmade called 1876 Reserve. I’m guessing the manufacturer either drank too much Dominican rum or his abacus was busted. Don’t get me wrong, I certainly ain’t complaining because I think under normal circumstances it would’ve cost me twice as much to buy what I bought (I better remove his name from the mailing list so he doesn’t see this later). What I do know is that this is an incredibly mellow Dominican cigar that’s well worth our ridiculous 2-fer price. In fact, the buy-in here starts under two bucks apiece! Is that too cheap? Maybe it’s me that’s getting soft in the head. Oh well, if you like easy going cigars, you’ll love this deal.</td>\n",

That's right, the fan-favorite 1876 Reserve now comes draped in a dark, juicy maduro wrapper leaf. The profile is still relatively tame, yet the darker, richer leaf adds a welcomed layer of complexity. And better yet, the price is exactly the same, right around two bucks apiece. I don't like taking credit when it's not due, but I definitely deserve a pat on the back for this one. Well-made Dominican lovelies stuffed with aged Dominican long-fillers and sporting a toothy maduro wrapper, all for pennies on the dollar.

Handmade by the folks behind the famed Davidoff brand, 3x3 tubos are produced in the Dominican Republic and feature a silky-smooth Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper leaf.

Dressed in a stunning, reddish-hued Corojo wrapper from Nicaragua - one that’s dark and oozing with oils - this 6\"x52 Toro is lovingly box-pressed for maximum flavor. Beneath this exquisite wrapper, a bold combination of aged ligeros from Nicaragua, Honduras, and beyond has been expertly blended. Cask-Strength opens with a feisty bouquet loaded with hearty spices.

Spicy throughout with a warm, toasty aroma, expect a full-bodied and full-flavored crescendo as you gradually approach the nub.

I’m guessing the manufacturer either drank too much Dominican rum or his abacus was busted. Don’t get me wrong, I certainly ain’t complaining because I think under normal circumstances it would’ve cost me twice as much to buy what I bought (I better remove his name from the mailing list so he doesn’t see this later). What I do know is that this is an incredibly mellow Dominican cigar that’s well worth our ridiculous 2-fer price. In fact, the buy-in here starts under two bucks apiece! Is that too cheap? Maybe it’s me that’s getting soft in the head. Oh well, if you like easy going cigars, you’ll love this deal.   \n",

And now, without further delay, enter 1876 Reserve Maduro. That's right, the fan-favorite 1876 Reserve now comes draped in a dark, juicy maduro wrapper leaf. The profile is still relatively tame, yet the darker, richer leaf adds a welcomed layer of complexity. And better yet, the price is exactly the same, right around two bucks apiece. I don't like taking credit when it's not due, but I definitely deserve a pat on the back for this one. Well-made Dominican lovelies stuffed with aged Dominican long-fillers and sporting a toothy maduro wrapper, all for pennies on the dollar. You can put this one at the top of the list for best damn value around.    \n",

On paper, this cigar shouldn’t work. It’s just a collection of 9 cigars, packaged in three rows of three, that each come in aluminum tubes. But the secret to this one is in the sauce! Handmade by the folks behind the famed Davidoff brand, 3x3 tubos are produced in the Dominican Republic and feature a silky-smooth Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper leaf. Underneath, you’ll find Dominican binder and long-fillers, delivering a toasty, earthy, slightly spicy profile with a smooth finish you’ll certainly love.   \n",

       "5 Vegas Cask-Strength  A luxurious encore presentation.The term ’cask strength’ is a term single-malt scotch and malt whisky enthusiasts are familiar with.
