1876 Reserve,5 out of 5,1876 Torpedos,"The 1876 is my everyday cigar. I enjoy the mild Connecticut wrapper and their good draw. Price is O.K.
Two comments:
1. Several long stems in the tobacco leaves. Some are almost 4"" long. Thick, tough and gnarly. I pull the large ones out using forceps. Messy to do that.
2. Wrapper tends to de-laminate when cigar band is removed. Suggest that less glue (or none) is used on the band."

3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,4 out of 5,It's a true Cigar,"No.1 is the price point. This cigar is clean, enjoyable, and allows a true tobacco experience. Just can't go wrong here ;)"
3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,4 out of 5,Look cheap but got great taste,Mild flavor and burns steady - very nice. But the cigars don’t come with any label so they look cheap.
3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,5 out of 5,5-Star Budget Smoke,"I’m writing this after smoking about 5 ROTT, and...I like ‘em! A lot. I got them for a steal, and I’m definitely coming back for more. I’ve been looking for a shade wrapper for a morning smoke that edges a little more toward medium, and this one does. Some black pepper, lots of grass and sweet cream, all the good stuff. I’ve heard that these are rolled by Davidoff’s apprentice rollers, and I mostly can’t tell from construction. If I’m being critical, they are a LITTLE bit softer than I’d like, and because of that they smoke kind of quick. There is variation in the wrapper color. That’s about all of the cons, tho."
3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,5 out of 5,Can't beat it...,Davidoff Churchill for $3 a piece; I'll take that every time.
3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,4 out of 5,No disappointments!,Truly clean... pleasant... enjoyable cigar. Price point unmatched for pure tobacco flavor. Great golfing cigar or compliment to a stronger stick. No disappointments.

3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,5 out of 5,Super Value and Quality,"Love tubos for travel but these impressed my brother-in-law. Front porch laugh session, he comments on the beautiful cylinder of ash and the balance of medium flavor. For once I agreed with him."
3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,5 out of 5,Perfect cheap and mild.,"This is the mild smokers dream. No it does not have complex ANYTHING. It is just mild, end of day, Irish whiskey on a rock, easy draw, kind of stick. It does'nt change flavor. It does'nt bite my tongue half way with BOLDNESS. It's just mild, easy drawing, relaxing. If you need complex boldness with stiff bulldog draw and relighting at odd moments constantly? You won't like this. OH YEA it doesn't cost 10 bucs a stick either. I am writing this one handed with a 3x3 clenched between my teeth and a whiskey right now."

THANK YOU C.I. for making this DAVIDOFF soooooooooooooo affordable.
3x3 Tubos by Davidoff,5 out of 5,This guy is tubo happy.,"Very, very pleased with the tubos. The cigar is better than I expected and worth every penny. Unexpectedly, they stay lit even when put down to make a shot on the golf course. My preference is mild to medium and these are exactly what I like.
I'll buy more."

5 Vegas Big Five,4 out of 5,Better than expected...,"Got these on a lark off of MMAO. Was pleasantly surprised what a nice tasting stick it was. Have not been a real big fan of 5 Vegas in the past, but these might change my mind.
There was a little bit of a contsruction issue. I pulled a pretty large stem out of the end, but other than that, a nice smooth, even burn."
5 Vegas Big Five,4 out of 5,Big 5 robusto,"I waited for an amazing deal from CI on these. As an avid smoker of 5 Vegas classic I had to try the new blend. Medium body, good cherry notes and consistent during the burn, holds an ash like a pro, burns cool also. The last 2” is where it changes and gets fuller, gets a bit hot at 1.5” but yummy good. 4 stars is a good rating for this one. You won’t be disappointed"

At times, but still a good stick"
5 Vegas Big Five,3 out of 5,A bit hard to draw,"The flavor was nice, my first experience with this cigar was good so I bought more. This time, three cigars into the ten pack, they seem a bit hard to draw from."
5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,Great prices great cigars,Great price on a darn good cigar
5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,Vegas 5 cigars,"Very smooth draw, a little big, wish it came in a smaller ring size. Make some time to smoke this one, but a great smoke like all Vegas 5 cigars."

5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,5 Vegas,Great cigar
5 Vegas Big Five,1 out of 5,Horribly tough draw!,Received this cigar as part of my haul from Cigar Fest. This was the tightest packed cigar I’ve ever smoked. An absolute brick. Gave myself a headache trying to get a decent draw. Gave up halfway. Maybe I just got a bad batch.

5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,the big5 is the big tasty,very good small gigar with great flavors and a decent draw
5 Vegas Big Five,3 out of 5,Okay,Not the best smoke by 5 Vegas.
5 Vegas Big Five,2 out of 5,Excitement to disappointment,"I was very excited to get these cigars. I have now smoked 5 of them and really like the taste. They smoke nice and even. But, 4 of the 5 have came unwrapped while I have been smoking them. I keep my humidor between 71-73. They have all seemed dry and brittle. I am very disappointied, as I am a big fan of Vegas Cigars. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Curious to watch future reviews."
5 Vegas Big Five,2 out of 5,Poor Condition,I bought a box of these which came with another bundle of 10 for an up charge. The bundled cigars are so dried out that as soon as one is lit the wrapper cracks completely down the side and peels. I don't know what the condition of the boxed cigars are as I haven't opened them yet. Ordered these before and really enjoyed them. Not sure I would take a chance again.

5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,Big Vega 5 Torpedo,"Great cigar, good burning, flavorful and a gret smoke. Definitely will buy again!"
5 Vegas Big Five,2 out of 5,No good,"Very disappointed with this series. I was like a kid in a candy shop when I saw these and ordered 40 because of the quality I’ve always gotten. Well unfortunately these are horrible. Had them in a humidor for 2 months now and the only way I can get the to burn is to toss them into a fire pit. All were dry, hard and no matter how hard I try no draw. Wrappers fell off as soon as they were taken from the humidor as well."
5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,Nice cigar for the price,CI doubled the amount of cigars for $5 making this a super great deal. Even without the deal I will purchase more. One of the best Vegas cigars produced!
5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,5 Vegas Big Five,Nice construction and full/medium bodied flavor. I like these fire plugs.
5 Vegas Big Five,2 out of 5,vegas 5 big 5,"slightly disappointed w/ this stick. first im a huge fan of the vegas 5 brand. so when i purchased these i had high expectations. let them sit in humidor for 2 weeks,and first smoke seem really dry. let them sit 1 month. and not so dry but now didnt like the flavor. oh well . probally wouldnt buy these again."
5 Vegas Big Five,5 out of 5,"Went through 10, please sir, can I have some more.","I have been a fan of the 5 Vegas line for many years, but it seemed like they were basically getting set in their ways. I will have to say first off that I am normally not a fan of the large ring gauges, however this one was a little different. The construction was very good, no issues with the wrappers, binders, or filler at all. I even cut one way to close to the cap after having a drink or two and had no issues smoking it. The flavors as very good. It is a bold earthy flavor, with notes of cedar, and a black pepper on the finish. Excellent smoke output and burn, which surprised me because I normally do not have luck with the larger ring gauges. I will definitely be purchasing these sticks again."
5 Vegas Big Five,4 out of 5,5 Vegas comes through again,"Flavorful, well constructed cigar as you would expect from makers of Classic, Series A and High Primings. Get them now with the excellent intro offer."

5 Vegas Cask-Strength,5 out of 5,Always room in my humidor for these,"I’ve smoked a box of these over the past year and they are fantastic. Every single one... Great construction, burn, with ample smoke output. The flavor profile of spices, pepper, nuts, and cocoa is sublime. A really great balance. I absolutely love the reddish hue of the corojo wrapper. You cannot go wrong with these for the price."

5 Vegas Cask-Strength,5 out of 5,"Full, rich 5 Vegas","This is one of my favorite cigars. Full, rich flavor, always enjoyable."
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,4 out of 5,Worthy,"Nice change in the 5 Vegas lineup. Very well constructed, rolled tightly enough to last a good hour plus but still draw nicely. Flavor in not timid but fairly rich and meaty but not overly complex. Comparable to many cigars costing much more, I think these will be on my watch list for good buying opportunities."

5 Vegas Cask-Strength,5 out of 5,Love 5 Vegas cask strength cigars,5 Vegas cigars in general are a great smoke. I especially enjoy the 5 Vegas Cask Strength with the 5 Vegas Maimi close behind.
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,4 out of 5,Good strong stick.,"This is another good smoke in the 5 Vegas line, my favorite being the Serie A. its a good slow smoke lasts for at least an hour and has a rich flavor that I love to indulge in. it starts out a little rough for some but levels off as you smoke. the only downside to this was the box press, I am not a big fan of square-ish cigars, but sometimes that's all you can get."
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,4 out of 5,Vega,Rick deep flavor
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,5 out of 5,High Quality Cigar,"I have smoke two of these cigars, one right off the truck and another after one week of humidor time and both cigars were fantastic.
The draw was perfect with only a slight amount of resistance, the soft box press feels very comfortable, and the smoke output is phenomenal. The body and strenght are medium - medium/full with deep sweet and spicy flavors. These are an incredible value when they are on sale."
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,4 out of 5,Great cigar all the way,Great cigar all the way up to the band smooth and not too strong even burn I would buy it again
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,5 out of 5,nice and strong,great taste great draw very satisfing
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,5 out of 5,Absolute Favorite,"I was introduced to 5 Vegas about 20 years ago by a guy that was rolling these cigars at an event at Islamorado, FL. I fell in love with the brand and have bought a great many over the years. But the Cask Strength is a cut above all their other products. A quality smoke at a very affordable price. You can't go wrong!!!"
5 Vegas Cask-Strength,4 out of 5,Vegas at home,I was happy to put one of these on rotation for the evening cigar and found they satisfy. I enjoyed the flavor and the burn rate.
