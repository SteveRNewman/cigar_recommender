1876 Reserve,Rated 4.3 out of 5, Based on 513 Ratings ,"Even gramps would be proud.On a trip to factories in the Dominican Republic some time ago, I was offered a boatload of a really nice, smooth handmade called 1876 Reserve. I’m guessing the manufacturer either drank too much Dominican rum or his abacus was busted. Don’t get me wrong, I certainly ain’t complaining because I think under normal circumstances it would’ve cost me twice as much to buy what I bought (I better remove his name from the mailing list so he doesn’t see this later). What I do know is that this is an incredibly mellow Dominican cigar that’s well worth our ridiculous 2-fer price. In fact, the buy-in here starts under two bucks apiece! Is that too cheap? Maybe it’s me that’s getting soft in the head. Oh well, if you like easy going cigars, you’ll love this deal.",Mellow,"['Churchill', 'Robusto', 'Toro', 'Torpedo']",Sumatra,Dominican,False,No,More Details,Dominican Republic,No,,"Churchill, Robusto, Toro, Torpedo",No,Connecticut,
1876 Reserve Maduro,Rated 4.19 out of 5, Based on 247 Ratings ,"A dark horse from 1876 Reserve.Maestro....drumroll please. And now, without further delay, enter 1876 Reserve Maduro. That's right, the fan-favorite 1876 Reserve now comes draped in a dark, juicy maduro wrapper leaf. The profile is still relatively tame, yet the darker, richer leaf adds a welcomed layer of complexity. And better yet, the price is exactly the same, right around two bucks apiece. I don't like taking credit when it's not due, but I definitely deserve a pat on the back for this one. Well-made Dominican lovelies stuffed with aged Dominican long-fillers and sporting a toothy maduro wrapper, all for pennies on the dollar.

5 Vegas Cask-Strength,Rated 4.5 out of 5, Based on 101 Ratings ,"A luxurious encore presentation.The term ’cask strength’ is a term single-malt scotch and malt whisky enthusiasts are familiar with.

5 Vegas Gold,Rated 4.52 out of 5, Based on 1322 Ratings ,"Solid gold.Despite the pomp and circumstance surrounding full-bodied, powerhouse cigars these days, smooth cigars still rule. Without a doubt, the uber-popular 5 Vegas Gold is the perfect example. This gorgeous creature is crafted by industry legend Nestor Plasencia with extensively aged tobaccos, including a beautiful, almost shimmering Ecuador Connecticut wrapper leaf with a rich satiny texture. This charming blend is the big easy. I’ll recite the reasons chapter and verse. Top quality tobaccos? Check. 5 year aged long-fillers? Check. Seamless wrappers? Check. Made in one of Honduras’ top factories? Check. Handsome packaging? Check. Toast the foot and take a draw. You’ll see some spirit up front: a slight nutty taste followed by some zesty peppery notes on the back of the palate. A feisty sucker! But instantly it mellows into a polished smoothness with ample creaminess. It stays utterly consistent from here on out, well-balanced with a sturdy creamy foundation, and booms out thick clouds.

The flavorful bouquet includes heavy doses of toasty earthiness served up in a rich but ultimately smooth fashion. The aftertaste is long and pleasant, featuring an enjoyable sweetness that relaxes your palate. The presentation is terrific: nestled inside an attractive, dark, Spanish cedar box, each cigar is handsomely dressed in cedar sleeves.

Aging Room Solera Sun Grown,Rated 2.5 out of 5, Based on 2 Ratings ,"Sun Grown, baby! Back in 2004, Rafael Nodal and his wife vacationed in Spain. I promise – the story gets more interesting. While there, Rafael discovered an aging process for wine, beer, and brandy called… you guessed it, the “Solera” process. And being the tobacco man he was, Nodal couldn’t wait to apply this unique aging process to premium cigars. Enter Solera: a full line of premiums from Aging Room, featuring four distinct wrappers and unique flavors across the board. The Aging Room Solera Sun Grown is a medium-bodied iteration of the blend. Once lit, you’ll find notes of maple, slight nuttiness, and a citrusy zest. It’s a bright a lively cigar, one that performs beautifully on its own, but just does as well with a nice glass of rum or bourbon to accompany it. Picking a favorite in this line would be a tough choice: but Sun Grown is certainly in the conversation. ",Medium,"['Figurado', 'Robusto']",Dominican,Dominican,False,No,More Details,Dominican Republic,No,,"Figurado, Robusto",No,Sun Grown,Aging Room Cigars

These are the names Alec Bradley Cigar Company’s founder, Alan Rubin, two sons. When Alan Rubin first started the company, they were just kids. But over the past 20 years, they have grown up in the business, learned the heritage, the tradition, techniques, and found a love for tobacco on their own. And Alec & Bradley Blind Faith is the first blend they have created on their own.It starts out with a deep brown Habano wrapper grown in Trojes, Honduras. Underneath is a double binder combination from Honduras and Nicaragua that creates a sturdy, slow burning cigar. The meat is a three-leaf combination or Nicaraguan long-fillers. Medium to full-bodied, Blind Faith provides an evolving cadence of personality. A strong spicy note off the bat gives way to flavors of pepper, nuttiness, and earthiness.

Cain by Oliva,Rated 4.69 out of 5, Based on 32 Ratings ,"Straight ligero, baby.Hand-crafted in the Oliva factory of Nicaragua, Cain is a powerful blend of patiently aged, triple-fermented tobaccos. Available in two varieties - a thick and leathery Habano and a dark, oily Maduro - Cain utilizes superior long-leaf ligeros from Nicaragua’s three major growing regions: Esteli, Condega, and Jalapa. The cigar is eventful and complex, delivering a full-bodied, full-flavored assortment of deep, hearty flavors in smooth fashion. Hearty spices mingle with a deep tobacco core and Cuban-esque qualities, smacking the palate with notes of earth and coffee along the way. The abundance of thicker ligero leaves provide a slower burn, allowing you to truly appreciate each long-lasting puff, as the cigar grows more intense in both flavor and strength toward the nub.The newer Cain ‘F’ is a bold new Nicaraguan blend, a stout addition to the family which delivers a full-throttle array of heady, satisfying flavors. Draped in a thick, dark brown Habano leaf and stuffed with an extra-generous dose of Nicaraguan ligeros, Cain ‘F’ is nothing if not full-bodied. Yet it’s unexpectedly smooth and balanced with a deep, rich flavor profile featuring notes of spices, earth, leather and coffee. Slow-burning, complex and robust, Cain ‘F’ sets a new benchmark in extra-full-bodied handmades.Cain Habano 'F' received a well-deserved 92-point rating, noting:""Solidly rolled with a dark, oily and attractive wrapper. The draw is bit firm, but instantly delivers rich, bold notes of leather and spice that intensify in both flavor and body.""As if that wasn't enough, Cain Habano received a '90' rating, commenting:""This toothy torpedo wears an oily wrapper.

Everyone is trying to up the ante in one way or another. Some are flush and some are bust, but it never hinders manufacturers from giving it a go.

Camacho BG Meyer Standard Issue,Rated 4.5 out of 5, Based on 20 Ratings ,"BG Meyer…If you haven’t heard about the BG Meyer Standard Issue cigar, don’t worry. I am here to impart some knowledge. “What is a BG Meyer,” you may be asking yourself? Not a hot dog, but the newest addition to the already stunning arsenal that is Camacho Cigars. In a monumental revamping effort, Camacho created the “Board of the Bold,” a star-studded cast of brand directors including Mike Ditka, Matt Booth, and the person behind the BG Meyer Company, Rob Weiss. Rob Weiss is well-known in the cinema industry as one of the writers and producers on the hit HBO series, “Entourage!” I never heard of him, but he’s got a Wikipedia…and that’s proof enough for me. Plus, the cigar’s pretty damn tasty. So that’s that. BG Meyer’s Standard Issue stays true to the “Board of the Bold” name, delivering a medium-full bodied experience. A true gem, rare Dominican fillers are nestled within a Dominican binder. To cap it all off, an exquisite Ecuador Connecticut wrapper is draped over top, producing notes of wood, vanilla bean, and sweet spices.

CAO Orellana,Rated 5 out of 5, Based on 2 Ratings ,"From deep within the amazon, to deep within the aging room.In 2014, CAO announced a mysterious new cigar that piqued the collective interest of the cigar world. That cigar was the Amazon Basin, and utilized a special leaf in the filler known as Braganca. This rare tobacco is grown in patches of available sunlight in the Amazon, before being hand-rolled into tubes and rowed in canoes to the factory. This cigar spawned two offshoots, all using varying types and amounts of Amazonian tobacco and all selling out relatively quick. Now CAO is completing the series with the Orellano, the name given to the Amazon by explorer Francisco de Orellana. Despite this being the fourth cigar in the Amazon series, the Orellana’s Brazilian Cubra wrapper has been patiently aging since before CAO even discovered the Braganca used in the original. Cubra grows smaller, darker, leaves than most plants, and produces a pleasantly spicy, complex profile. The exotic wrapper is joined by a Nicaraguan binder and fillers from the Dominican & Colombia, with a healthy amount of Brazilian Braganca and Fuma Em Corda to ensure this cigar tastes like nothing you’ve ever had before.

Crowned Heads Jericho Hill,Rated 3.78 out of 5, Based on 9 Ratings ,"An ode to the Man in Black.No, not Will Smith. This cigar is dedicated to the true Man in Black, the one and only Johnny Cash. The folks over at Crowned Heads are  sticking to their musically themed cigar lines and have decided to honor Cash with their newest release, Jericho Hill. One of the most influential American singer/songwriters of all time, Johnny’s checkered past compelled him to perform one of his most famous tracks –  Cocaine Blues, from his renowned concert at Folsom Prison. This is the ballad of a scorned man named Willy Lee whose drug induced rage got him arrested by a sheriff from Jericho Hill. Every aspect of this cigar takes inspiration from the song.Jericho Hill boasts a dark and sultry Mexican San Andres wrapper, which is a nod to both Juarez, Mexico, where Willy Lee was arrested, and to Johnny’s nickname, “Man in Black.” Nicaraguan long-fillers and a Nicaraguan binder help to give Jericho Hill some serious attitude (just like Johnny had). Stuffed to the brim with blasts of pepper, spice, and leather, this is one full-bodied firecracker. Only the most potent of blends would suffice in paying tribute to a legend of Johnny Cash’s stature, and this one fits the bill. RIP, JC.Crowned Heads Jericho Hill received a well-deserved 90-rating noting: ""Dark in appearance and flatly pressed, this cigar starts out herbal and woody, but develops heartier notes of toast, nuts and spice that lead to a licorice finish.

As the burn progresses, notes of tobacco, leather, and cream enter the fray with a tick of sweetness on the finish.

Due to its well-balanced blend, Cult is never overpowering, or unbalanced, and provides smooth soft flavors you can enjoy any time of day.

Diesel Whiskey Row,Rated 4.63 out of 5, Based on 76 Ratings ,"Diesel LibationIf you’ve been around these parts long enough, you’re well aware of the Diesel brand. No-nonsense, full-flavored, and expert construction. These phrases no doubt come to mind. Diesel Whiskey Row stays true, but takes a unique approach for the brand. The binder is aged in Rabbit Hole Bourbon barrels – a first for Diesel as well as master blender AJ Fernandez. But have no fear – these bourbon barrels that once held Rabbit Hole Bourbon were first shipped to AJ Fernandez in 2016. After many months of testing, he finally nailed down a process that imparts the perfect amount of flavor and aroma into the tobacco and Diesel Whiskey Row was born. The core of this cigar is made up entirely of Nicaraguan long-fillers from 3 different growing regions - Ometepe, Jalapa, and Condega – that have been aged from five to eight years. The bourbon barrel aged binder is a Mexican San Andres leaf, and it’s all held together five-years aged Ecuadorian habano wrapper. The barrel aging produces a strong oaky flavor and hints of bourbon in the aroma. You’ll also notice some floral notes, spice and some sweetness in a medium-bodied format. In my many, many samplings of this cigar, the construction has been nothing short of flawless – something we’ve come to expect from AJ-made cigars. Grab a box of these unique Diesels today, pair ‘em with a few fingers of the good stuff, and you won’t be disappointed. Good news! Diesel Whiskey Row has received a well-deserved 91-point rating, noting: ""The earthy, chocolate notes of this cigar frame a hearty core of wood and cedar, all combining for a finish of bread and brown sugar.""",Medium,"['Churchill', 'Gigante', 'Robusto', 'Toro']",Mexican,Nicaraguan,False,No,More Details,Nicaragua,No,,"Churchill, Gigante, Robusto, Toro",No,Ecuador Habano,Diesel

The Diesel Whiskey Row was released in 2018 to a wave of excitement from cigar aficionados everywhere, owing to the fantastic blend and bold flavors from the binder aged in Rabbit Hole bourbon barrels. The follow-up to that fantastic success uses barrels that originally contained 30-year old Pedro Ximenez Sherry which were sent to Rabbit Hole to produce their PX Sherry Finish Bourbon, before finally landing at Tabacalera AJ Fernandez in Nicaragua.The blend consists of a dark Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper and Nicaraguan fillers, but the barrel-aged Brazilian Arapiraca binder is the star of the show. The flavors are wonderfully influenced by the sherry casks, without becoming infused or overly sweet. Instead, you’ll find notes of dark fruit, cedar, chocolate, and pepper, for a smooth medium-bodied experience that pairs great with any drinks with naturally sweet characteristics. Diesel crated something truly special & unique with this release, so you won’t want to hesitate to go down the Rabbit Hole. Good news!

Closer examination revealed the number of cigars on the bundle manually scribbled out with a Sharpie. Bearable, I guess. But it gets worse. The ‘Don Jesus’ label was obviously applied over another label to intentionally cover it up. Underneath? Another label of a brand called Desperado Seconds. A cigar described in print, on the sticker, by the manufacturer as, “These are not first quality cigars, not stemless, perfect, or spectacular in any way.” Good. Now that my cards are all on the table, here’s the happy ending. We burnt a bundle. They’re not that bad, and I want to wash my hands of this mess quickly.

With Don Tomas Clasico Maduro, the brand celebrates its Honduran origin, putting the tobaccos of the country on full spotlight beneath a seamless, oily Maduro wrapper leaf. The blend itself is no slouch, either - this cigar features the same blend as the original Don Tomas release, with just a few tweaks around the wrapper.Wrapped in a bold Connecticut Broadleaf overtop Connecticut Maduro binder and Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers, Don Tomas delivers tons of flavor without ever overwhelming. Toasting the foot, you'll find tons of charred wood, chocolate, black pepper, and a backing of natural tobacco sweetness - a combination that practically begs to be paired up with a few fingers of the good stuff.

Jeff Borysiewicz of Florida Sun Grown Farms, along with the fellas at Drew Estate, is here to change that by pushing the American tobacco movement in hopes that people will be excited to bring American tobacco agriculture back to the forefront.

The infused line of ACID cigars is a perennial best seller. And their traditional cigars have been praised by all the critics. When Willy Herrera joined team DE in 2013, he created the Herrera Esteli line and then followed it up with Herrera Esteli Norteno.

Drew Estate Herrera Esteli Habano,Rated 4.5 out of 5, Based on 2 Ratings ,"Big Willy Style....Welcome Herrera Esteli cigars, the newest addition to join the ranks of Drew Estate's massive portfolio. As with the Liga and Undercrown lines, Herrera Esteli further solidifies Drew Estate's presence in non-infused, traditional cigars. This time, the story starts with Willy Herrera. He was a tobacco guru at the famed El Titan de Bronze factory in Miami, responsible for some of the most sought after and highly-rated handmades around. And once he combined forces with Drew Estate, he took like a duck to water. What you see here is the result of sampling and tweaking dozens upon dozens of blends, and the final process is as close to perfection as you can get. From the vintage Cuban-esque bands to the cabinet style box, Herrera Esteli screams Cuba. And the glue sealing the whole thing together is the blend. Oh-so-creamy, yet highly representative of Cuban cigars of old. It's got some oomph, but the flavors are delivered in such a velvety fashion the power is beautifully masked. Crisp, clean notes of spices, cedar, cream, and roasted nuts are the backbone, as occasional hints of white pepper and semi-sweet vanilla weave masterfully throughout. Initial puffs foreshadow a medium-bodied profile, but the slow burn begins to unveil a different story, as it inches toward a medium to full-bodied crescendo. If the Liga Privada series is a cup of black coffee, Herrera Esteli is without a doubt the ""with cream"" option. A handmade of the highest caliber, Herrera Esteli is going to turn some heads.In addition to multiple 93-ratings, Herrera Esteli received a well-deserved 94-rating as well as Top 25 honors for 2014, #8 overall.

From the infused ACID line to the traditional wares like Liga Privada and Undercrown, everything coming out of La Gran Fabrica Drew Estate in Nicaragua competes with the best in the industry. One of their finest cigars is without a doubt the 94-rated Herrera Esteli. In 2016 we saw an offshoot of the blend produced at master Blender Willy Herrera’s former factory, El Titan de Bronze, in Miami in a tasty Corona Gorda size. At the 2018 IPCPR show the blend went full scale releasing four new sizes. The core of the blend consists of Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers that are bunched up entubar style – an old Cuban technique that is very labor intensive but provides a great draw. It’s all held together by leaves from Ecuador. A Sumatra-seed leaf is used for the binder while a dark Ecuador Habano Oscuro wrapper lays overtop, secured by a triple seam cap. It’s a smooth full-bodied blend with flavors sweet cedar, earth, and espresso. Whether you tried the original Corona Gorda or not, you should check out these new sizes. They’re only rolled by level 9 rollers from Cuba so you can count on high quality construction and the flavors are fantastic. Good news!

Drafting off of the success of his first release under the Drew Estate umbrella, Herrera Esteli Norteno has finally arrived. This new release pays homage to Esteli, Nicaragua – the home of Drew Estate and Herrera Esteli. Norteno, meaning “northerners” in Spanish, was chosen as the name due to people from Esteli being referred to as ‘Nortenos.’This full-bodied firecracker is no joke, boasting long-fillers from the fertile Nicaraguan growing regions of Jalapa and Esteli, both known for producing bold n’ hearty tobaccos. A Honduran binder cloaks these leaves with an oily San Andres Maduro wrapper draped over top. This long-anticipated release delivers bold notes of pepper and chocolate that endure to the finish and are backed by hints of cashew, cocoa, and espresso.

Drew Estate MUWAT Kentucky Fire Cured,Rated 4.6 out of 5, Based on 619 Ratings ,"Generally speaking, the offerings in the Drew Estate portfolio are pretty unique. That has a lot to do with why the brand is so damn popular to begin with. But now this latest line extension to MUWAT has taken things to a whole new level, taste-wise. This phrase gets thrown around a lot, but this time it couldn’t be more accurate – you’ve never tasted anything like this before.The biggest difference with Kentucky Fire-Cured is the inclusion of – you guessed it! – American fire-cured tobacco leaves from Kentucky and Virginia. While normally tobacco is air-cured, these special leaves are left to hang in specially-constructed curing barns, a process that dates back more than 200 years and that imbues each leaf with a rich, smoky, slightly sweet flavor that boasts exceptional balance and uniqueness. Notes of oak, hickory, and maple-laced sweetness explode on the palate. These leaves are joined by Nicaraguan and Brazilian Mata Fina long-fillers along with an oily San Andres maduro wrapper. This finished product is like nothing else on the market. Been looking for a totally uncommon taste experience that’ll blow your hair back? You just found it. Want something really special?

This handmade cigar is the first Nicaraguan addition to the Gispert brand. And it’s a dark, full-bodied one at that. Blended by the Grupo de Maestros and A.J.

The blend is a simple recipe. A Connecticut broadleaf wrapper is met with Nicaraguan binder and Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers.

Gurkha Harlequiss,Rated 4.45 out of 5, Based on 11 Ratings ,"Gurkha's ready for spellcheck! 
Right about here is where I’d normally tell you the elaborate, rich history behind a cigar. Perhaps it’s a Spanish word that needs translation, perhaps it relates to the tobaccos or the fermentation process, perhaps it’s a clever pun… or perhaps it’s Harlequiss. Yes, truly the result of a drunken night and a lack of an editor, Harlequiss is the newest Gurkha premium to land at CI. 
Now while the name may cause chuckles, the blend is no joke. Crafted in limited-edition quantities in the Dominican Republic, each Harlequiss features a girthy ring-gauge and an exceptionally slow burn. Puff after puff, you’ll find complexly layered notes of earth, leather, spice, and a core of crisp, natural tobacco, Harlequiss is sure to keep you coming back for more time and time again.

Labeling a cigar as ‘Legend’ is a bold claim that cannot be backed by just any cigar maker. Fortunately, Gurkha is not your ordinary, everyday cigar maker.

The process however, is not so simple. Gurkha Cigars holds the highest of standards, and expects perfection and excellence out of every cigar created. In order to achieve these high standards, the Legend must patiently undergo an extensive aging process of 8 long years.

Resting atop this aged core is an enticing chocolaty-brown 8-year old Dominican wrapper. Upon toasting the rugged foot, the binder and filler provide an insightful experience as to the taste of a cigar sans its wrapper. (Truly very unique if you have yet to experience it.) As the burn reaches the wrapper, warm flavors swarm the palate engulfing the senses as smooth notes of tobacco, oak, spice, and a hint of vanilla round out this medium-bodied treat. Not your normal Gurkha, heck – not your normal cigar, the Shaggy is a must try.",Medium,['Gordo'],Nicaraguan,Nicaraguan,False,No,More Details,Nicaragua,No,,Gordo,No,Dominican,Gurkha

H. Upmann The Banker,Rated 4.62 out of 5, Based on 34 Ratings ,"This one comes straight from the vault.Legend has it that Carl and Herman Upmann, a pair of ambitious German bankers, traveled to Cuba in 1844 with the intention of creating the perfect cigar. This top-secret blend was reserved solely for their most important (read: wealthiest) clients, and was locked in a vault to keep it away from prying eyes. Unfortunately, the bank burned down in the 20s, but luckily enough for you and me, attempts have been made to reintroduce this special concoction. That’s where H. Upmann The Banker comes into play.Swathed in a super-dark Ecuadorian Habano wrapper and filled to the gills with vintage long-filler leaves from Nicaragua and the Dominican, this bold treat is worth writing home about. Spicy enough to keep you on your toes without overwhelming, the blend is medium in body with a distinctly creamy texture and features solid, earthy notes. It’s the perfect choice for your favorite hedge fund manager, or for anyone who appreciates a well-made, intensely satisfying Cuban-esque premium handmade with a bit of history behind it.H.

This sits atop a Dominican binder and filler, and provides a toasty, Cuban-esque accent to the mellow-medium bodied notes of cream, nuts, and cedar. A touch of pepper guarantees this is a blend that won’t make you yawn, and the excellent construction ensures you won’t have to put them down until you’re burning your fingers.

Joya de Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva,Rated 5 out of 5, Based on 1 Rating ,"Antano gets a faceliftAmong the questions I get asked the most, “How are aged cigars different than non-aged ones?” is number three, right behind, “Y’all got Cubans?” and “Can I have some free samples?”. Today, Joya de Nicaragua lends us a hand in answering this age old question, with the release of Antano Gran Reserva. Modeled after their flagship Antano line, Gran Reserva is a similar blend, with the addition of aged tobaccos to provide a more “mature” experience. Manufactured at Joya de Nicaragua’s operation in Esteli, Nicaragua, Joya de Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva is a Nicaraguan puro of the highest caliber. To set this one apart from its peers, Juan Martinez (Executive President of JdN), called for the addition of five-year-aged filler leaves to the mix and applied a rich and oily Corojo wrapper on top. The result is markedly different from the regular Antano: what was once a powerful, unabashed beast has been tamed, offering a much smoother ride. There’s still hits of black pepper up front, but they’re quickly joined by natural, sugary sweetness, nutty notes, and dry chocolate. Good News! Joya De Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva has been awarded as the #16 best cigar of 2018 and earned an awesome 93-point rating, noting: ""this attractive cigar has a pleasantly toasty core that's elevated by hints of saffron, hickory wood and chocolate.

Judge Wright by JC Newman,Rated 4.35 out of 5, Based on 162 Ratings ,"Give this cigar a fair trial.In the 1920’s J.C. Newman’s top-selling cigar was a little brand known as “Judge Wright.” Back then, the line had a simple slogan, “A fair trial will give a verdict in favor of this cigar.” Now, I’ve got to be honest. My experience with any sort of court is limited to Judge Judy and Law and Order reruns. However, if I were a judge, I’d throw anyone who didn’t like this cigar out, as they must be insane. This cigar is a straight up value, and I’d recommend getting in early and often. Judge Wright is a Nicaraguan puro with a Sun Grown wrapper, but unlike some similar blends, this one stays smooth and medium-bodied throughout. The ‘Cuban sandwich’ blend has great flavors of earth, leather, and slight spice. There’s nothing else I can say here, Judge Wright is a great everyday cigar.
